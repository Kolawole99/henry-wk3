# Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Policy Owner:** General Counsel
**Contract Management System:** Ironclad

## Overview
This policy outlines the mandatory requirements for sharing confidential information with external parties. An NDA must be executed *before* any proprietary information is exchanged.

## When is an NDA Required?
* **Mandatory:**
    * Discussing unreleased product features or roadmaps.
    * Sharing financial data, customer lists, or employee salaries.
    * Engaging with freelancers or consultants.
    * Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) talks.
* **Not Required:**
    * Sharing public marketing materials.
    * Standard sales demos of *released* products.
    * Conversations based solely on public website information.

## Standard NDA Terms
* **Governing Law:** State of Delaware.
* **Term of Confidentiality:** 3 Years from the date of disclosure.
* **Trade Secrets:** Protected continuously (no expiration).
* **Jurisdiction:** New York County, New York.

## Templates & Usage
All templates are available in **Ironclad**. Do not download PDF templates from the internet.

### 1. Mutual NDA (Preferred)
* **Use Case:** Strategic partnerships, vendor evaluations where we share data, joint ventures.
* **Approval:** No legal review required if using the standard Ironclad template without changes.

### 2. One-Way NDA (Outbound)
* **Use Case:** We are disclosing info to a vendor (e.g., an agency pitching us ideas).
* **Approval:** No legal review required for standard template.

### 3. One-Way NDA (Inbound)
* **Use Case:** A vendor wants to show us their "secret sauce."
* **Warning:** **Avoid signing these.** We prefer Mutual NDAs to protect ourselves from "contamination" claims.
* **Approval:** **Legal Review Mandatory.**

## The Approval Process
1.  **Generate:** Log into Ironclad and select "New Workflow" -> "NDA".
2.  **Send:** Enter the counterparty's email. Ironclad automatically sends via DocuSign.
3.  **Negotiation:**
    * If the counterparty signs as-is: **Instant Approval.**
    * If the counterparty redlines (edits) the document: The workflow automatically routes to `legal@company.com`.
4.  **SLA:** Legal reviews redlines within **2 business days**.

## Red Flags (Do Not Sign)
If a counterparty sends their own NDA, look for these "Deal Breakers." Legal will reject them:
* **Non-Solicit Clauses:** We do not agree to restrict our ability to hire.
* **Non-Compete Clauses:** We never sign non-competes in an NDA.
* **Perpetual Confidentiality:** Except for trade secrets, we require a time limit (max 5 years).
* **Indemnification:** We do not indemnify for simple NDAs.

## 6. Special Situations

### 6.1 Multi-Party NDAs
When three or more parties need to share confidential information (e.g., joint ventures, consortium arrangements):
* Use **Multi-Party NDA** template from Ironclad
* Each party owes confidentiality obligations to all other parties
* Requires legal review regardless of template usage
* Coordination time: Allow 2-3 weeks for all parties to sign

### 6.2 Confidentiality in Employment Agreements
Employee confidentiality is covered in standard employment agreements and does not require separate NDAs.

**Exception:** Contractors and consultants require standalone NDAs or confidentiality clauses in their service agreements.

### 6.3 Academic and Research Collaborations
Universities and research institutions often have their own NDA templates:
* Generally acceptable to use their forms (less risk profile)
* Must still submit for Legal review
* Watch for: Publication rights, IP ownership, indirect cost provisions
* Approval: Requires VP Research or CTO sign-off

### 6.4 Government and Public Sector
Government agencies may require specific NDA formats or may refuse to sign NDAs:
* Federal agencies typically do not sign NDAs (FOIA exemptions apply instead)
* State/local governments vary by jurisdiction
* Defense contractors may require SF312 or DD254 forms
* Coordinate with Legal and Compliance for export control implications

## 7. Confidentiality in Specific Business Contexts

### 7.1 Sales Engagements
**Proof of Concept (POC):**
* NDA required before customer receives access to non-production environments
* Standard Mutual NDA acceptable
* Include data deletion obligations post-POC

**RFP/RFI Responses:**
* If RFP includes confidential customer information, execute NDA before receiving documents
* Our RFP responses should be marked "Confidential" on cover page
* Retain copies for 3 years per recordkeeping policy

### 7.2 Vendor Evaluations
Before evaluating new vendors (SaaS tools, professional services):
1. Execute Mutual NDA before product demonstrations if they'll see our data
2. Execute One-Way NDA (Outbound) if we're disclosing architecture, data volumes, or user counts
3. NDA should survive even if we don't select the vendor

**Duration:** Minimum 3 years; 5 years preferred for strategic vendor evaluations

### 7.3 M&A and Fundraising
**Acquisition Discussions:**
* Execute NDA before sharing financial data, customer lists, or strategic plans
* Include **standstill provisions** (prevent hostile takeover attempts)
* Include **no-solicit** clauses (prevent poaching employees)
* CEO and General Counsel must approve M&A NDAs

**Fundraising/Investor Relations:**
* Potential investors must sign NDA before receiving investor deck or financial projections
* Investment banks and VCs often resist signing; escalate to CFO/CEO for risk assessment
* Consider one-way NDA acceptable if investor is passive (not competitor)

### 7.4 Media and Press
**Interviews and Briefings:**
* Journalists generally will not sign NDAs (conflicts with editorial independence)
* Alternative: Use "embargo" agreements (information can be published after specific date)
* Product briefings under NDA require VP Marketing approval

**Exception:** Trade publications and analysts (Gartner, Forrester) routinely sign NDAs for early product briefings.

## 8. International Considerations

### 8.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction
**U.S. Counterparties:** Delaware or New York law preferred
**International Counterparties:**
* European entities: English law or Delaware law typically accepted
* Asian entities: May insist on local law (Singapore, Hong Kong acceptable; mainland China requires additional review)
* Latin America: Local law often required; Spanish translation may be needed

### 8.2 Language
* English is preferred and should be controlling language
* If counterparty requires translation, both versions should be signed with clause stating "English version controls in case of conflict"
* Translation costs are generally borne by requesting party

### 8.3 Export Controls
NDAs involving foreign persons or entities may trigger export control reviews:
* Sharing technical data related to defense, encryption, or dual-use technology
* "Deemed export" if sharing with foreign nationals in U.S.
* Coordinate with trade-compliance@company.com before execution

## 9. Digital Signature and Execution

### 9.1 DocuSign Workflow
Standard process:
1. Legal or business owner initiates DocuSign via Ironclad
2. Counterparty receives email with "Review and Sign" link
3. Counterparty signs electronically (click-to-accept)
4. System automatically routes to authorized company signer
5. Both parties receive fully executed copy via email

**Signature Order:** Typically counterparty signs first, then company signer receives notification.

### 9.2 Wet Signatures
Paper signatures ("wet ink") rarely required except:
* Government contracts
* Real estate transactions
* Some international jurisdictions not recognizing e-signatures

**Process for Wet Signatures:**
1. Print two originals
2. Company signs both copies
3. Mail to counterparty with return envelope
4. Counterparty signs and returns one original
5. Scan executed copy into Ironclad for recordkeeping

### 9.3 Authentication and Identity Verification
DocuSign employs:
* Email verification (standard)
* SMS authentication (for high-value transactions)
* Knowledge-based authentication (answer questions from credit bureau)
* ID verification (upload government ID) - available on request

**Company Policy:** Email verification sufficient for standard NDAs; SMS required for M&A NDAs.

## 10. Breach and Enforcement

### 10.1 Identifying a Breach
Potential breaches include:
* Public disclosure of confidential information (press, social media, conference)
* Sharing with unauthorized third parties
* Using confidential information for competitive purposes
* Failure to return/destroy information upon request

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Document the breach (screenshots, URLs, witness statements)
2. Notify legal@company.com within 24 hours
3. Preserve all evidence
4. Do not contact the breaching party directly

### 10.2 Remedies
**Cease and Desist Letter:**
* First response to most breaches
* Demands immediate halt to disclosure and return of materials
* Sets deadline (typically 5 business days)

**Injunctive Relief:**
* Court order prohibiting further disclosure
* Available for threatened breaches or ongoing violations
* Does not require proving monetary damages

**Monetary Damages:**
* Difficult to prove in NDA cases
* Must demonstrate: actual damages (lost profits, diminished trade secret value)
* May include punitive damages for willful violations

### 10.3 Notification Obligations
If our confidential information is breached by a counterparty, we may need to notify:
* Customers (if their data was exposed)
* Regulators (if PII involved - see Data Privacy Policy)
* Insurance carrier (cyber liability policy)
* Law enforcement (if criminal trade secret theft)

## 11. Training and Best Practices

### 11.1 Handling Confidential Information
**Receipt:**
- [ ] Mark emails/documents as "Confidential"
- [ ] Store in access-controlled folders (SharePoint, Google Drive with permissions)
- [ ] Do not forward to personal email
- [ ] Do not print unnecessarily

**Sharing:**
- [ ] Verify recipient is authorized under NDA
- [ ] Use encrypted email or secure file sharing (not regular email attachments for sensitive data)
- [ ] Include confidentiality notice in email: "This message contains confidential information pursuant to NDA dated [DATE]"

**Disposal:**
- [ ] Shred paper documents
- [ ] Securely delete electronic files (not just "delete" - use secure erase)
- [ ] Return or certify destruction when NDA term ends or upon request

### 11.2 Common Mistakes to Avoid
**Don't:**
* Discuss confidential information in public spaces (planes, cafes, conferences)
* Leave printed materials in conference rooms after meetings
* Use personal cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud) for company confidential info
* Share login credentials with counterparties (each should have own access)
* Post about confidential projects on social media (even vague references)

**Do:**
* Use "need to know" principle - only share with those who require access
* Watermark confidential presentations with "CONFIDENTIAL"
* Enable expiration dates on shared links when possible
* Log who accessed confidential information in critical deals

### 11.3 Employee Offboarding
When employees leave:
* IT disables access to confidential file repositories immediately
* Employee must certify in exit interview that all confidential information was returned/destroyed
* Post-employment confidentiality obligations survive termination (typically perpetual for trade secrets, 2-5 years for other info)
* Consider reminder letter to departed employee if they joined competitor

## 12. Metrics and Reporting

### 12.1 NDA Volume (FY2024)
* Mutual NDAs executed: 347
* One-Way NDAs (Outbound): 89
* One-Way NDAs (Inbound): 12
* M&A NDAs: 6
* Average execution time: 4.2 days (standard template), 8.7 days (negotiated)

### 12.2 Common Negotiation Points
Top 5 requested changes by counterparties:
1. Reduce term from 3 years to 2 years (accepted 60% of time)
2. Change governing law to their jurisdiction (accepted if mutually acceptable jurisdiction)
3. Remove audit rights (rarely accepted)
4. Narrow definition of confidential information (evaluated case-by-case)
5. Add carve-outs for regulatory disclosure (generally accepted with notice requirement)

## 13. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Can I sign an NDA on behalf of the company?**
A: Only if you have signature authority per the Signature Authority Matrix. Most employees cannot sign contracts. Use Ironclad workflow to route to authorized signer.

**Q2: A vendor sent their NDA via regular email and asked me to sign and return. What should I do?**
A: Do not sign. Upload their template to Ironclad and initiate Legal review. Ironclad will handle routing and electronic signature.

**Q3: We already have an NDA with a vendor from 2 years ago. Do we need a new one?**
A: Check the term in Ironclad. If NDA is still active and covers the scope of new discussions, you can rely on existing NDA. If expired or scope changed, execute new NDA.

**Q4: Can I use the same NDA for multiple projects with the same counterparty?**
A: Yes, if the NDA is written broadly to cover "business discussions" or "potential business relationship." Avoid NDAs tied to specific one-time projects.

**Q5: A startup is asking us to sign their NDA before a product demo. Should we?**
A: Generally no. Their demo should use publicly available information or anonymized data. If they insist, offer Mutual NDA instead of their One-Way form.

**Q6: What if I accidentally disclose confidential information before the NDA is signed?**
A: Notify legal@company.com immediately. We may be able to obtain retroactive NDA or at least document the disclosure was inadvertent. Do not continue discussions until NDA is executed.

**Q7: How long do we keep executed NDAs?**
A: Ironclad retains NDAs for 7 years after expiration per retention policy. Do not delete executed agreements.

**Q8: Can I negotiate NDA terms directly with the counterparty?**
A: No. All substantive negotiations must be handled by Legal. You may answer procedural questions (who will sign, when can we execute) but do not agree to change legal terms.

**Q9: A competitor wants to sign an NDA to discuss a partnership. Is this risky?**
A: Yes. Competitor NDAs create "contamination" risk (they may claim we stole their ideas). Legal will add disclaimers and may require senior executive approval. Avoid if possible.

**Q10: What happens if we breach an NDA we signed?**
A: Potential consequences include lawsuits for damages, injunctions, and reputational harm. Report any suspected breaches immediately to legal@company.com so we can mitigate.

**Q11: Can we share confidential information with our attorneys or accountants?**
A: Yes. NDAs typically include exceptions for disclosure to professional advisors under confidentiality obligations. Verify your NDA includes this carve-out.

**Q12: Do I need an NDA to talk to a potential acquirer?**
A: Yes. Never disclose non-public information about the company (financials, customer data, strategy) without an executed NDA. Coordinate with CFO and General Counsel.

## 14. NDA Checklist for Business Owners

Before requesting NDA execution:

- [ ] Confirmed we actually need to share confidential information (can't use public info?)
- [ ] Identified correct NDA type (Mutual, One-Way Outbound, or One-Way Inbound)
- [ ] Determined if standard template applies or if custom terms needed
- [ ] Obtained required pre-approvals (VP for M&A, CTO for research collaboration, etc.)
- [ ] Uploaded to Ironclad (not sending Word docs via email)
- [ ] Provided counterparty contact information (name, email, title, company)
- [ ] Set appropriate deadline in Ironclad ("Need by" date)
- [ ] Notified team members who will be sharing/receiving information once NDA is executed
- [ ] Established protocol for marking and tracking confidential materials
- [ ] Calendared NDA expiration date for renewal evaluation
