# Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Policy Owner:** General Counsel
**Contract Management System:** Ironclad

## Overview
This policy outlines the mandatory requirements for sharing confidential information with external parties. An NDA must be executed *before* any proprietary information is exchanged.

## When is an NDA Required?
* **Mandatory:**
    * Discussing unreleased product features or roadmaps.
    * Sharing financial data, customer lists, or employee salaries.
    * Engaging with freelancers or consultants.
    * Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) talks.
* **Not Required:**
    * Sharing public marketing materials.
    * Standard sales demos of *released* products.
    * Conversations based solely on public website information.

## Standard NDA Terms
* **Governing Law:** State of Delaware.
* **Term of Confidentiality:** 3 Years from the date of disclosure.
* **Trade Secrets:** Protected continuously (no expiration).
* **Jurisdiction:** New York County, New York.

## Templates & Usage
All templates are available in **Ironclad**. Do not download PDF templates from the internet.

### 1. Mutual NDA (Preferred)
* **Use Case:** Strategic partnerships, vendor evaluations where we share data, joint ventures.
* **Approval:** No legal review required if using the standard Ironclad template without changes.

### 2. One-Way NDA (Outbound)
* **Use Case:** We are disclosing info to a vendor (e.g., an agency pitching us ideas).
* **Approval:** No legal review required for standard template.

### 3. One-Way NDA (Inbound)
* **Use Case:** A vendor wants to show us their "secret sauce."
* **Warning:** **Avoid signing these.** We prefer Mutual NDAs to protect ourselves from "contamination" claims.
* **Approval:** **Legal Review Mandatory.**

## The Approval Process
1.  **Generate:** Log into Ironclad and select "New Workflow" -> "NDA".
2.  **Send:** Enter the counterparty's email. Ironclad automatically sends via DocuSign.
3.  **Negotiation:**
    * If the counterparty signs as-is: **Instant Approval.**
    * If the counterparty redlines (edits) the document: The workflow automatically routes to `legal@company.com`.
4.  **SLA:** Legal reviews redlines within **2 business days**.

## Red Flags (Do Not Sign)
If a counterparty sends their own NDA, look for these "Deal Breakers." Legal will reject them:
* **Non-Solicit Clauses:** We do not agree to restrict our ability to hire.
* **Non-Compete Clauses:** We never sign non-competes in an NDA.
* **Perpetual Confidentiality:** Except for trade secrets, we require a time limit (max 5 years).
* **Indemnification:** We do not indemnify for simple NDAs.
