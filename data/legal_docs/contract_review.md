# Contract Review and Approval Process

**System:** Ironclad (CLM)
**Signature Tool:** DocuSign

## Overview
No employee is authorized to sign a contract on behalf of the company unless they hold specific delegated authority (see "Signature Authority" below). All contracts must go through the Legal Review Workflow.

## Review Thresholds and SLAs

| Contract Type | Value (Annual) | Legal Review Required? | SLA (Turnaround) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NDA (Standard)** | N/A | No (Self-Service) | Instant |
| **Sales Order (Standard)** | Any | No (VP Sales Approval only) | Instant |
| **Vendor Contract** | < $10k | Optional (Manager Discretion) | 3 Business Days |
| **Vendor Contract** | $10k - $100k | **Yes** | 5 Business Days |
| **Vendor Contract** | > $100k | **Yes + CFO Approval** | 7-10 Business Days |
| **Software/SaaS** | Any | **Yes (Security & Privacy Review)** | 7-10 Business Days |

## The Review Process steps

### 1. Intake
* Upload the PDF/Word draft to Ironclad.
* Fill out the "Cover Sheet" (Deal value, renewal terms, business owner).
* **Crucial:** You must attach the **Security Review Approval** (from IT) if the vendor handles customer data.

### 2. Triage
* The Legal Operations Manager assigns the contract to a Counsel based on the department (e.g., Commercial, Marketing, Product).

### 3. Redlining
* Legal negotiates terms directly with the counterparty's counsel.
* *Note:* Business owners are responsible for negotiating **Commercial Terms** (Price, Quantity, Service Level), not Legal.

### 4. Signature
* Once terms are final, Legal "Unlocks" the document in Ironclad.
* The document is routed via DocuSign to the appropriate signer based on the Authority Matrix below.

## Signature Authority Matrix
*Who signs the dotted line?*

* **Individual Contributors / Managers:** $0 Authority. Cannot sign.
* **Directors:** Up to **$25,000**.
* **VPs:** Up to **$100,000**.
* **C-Level (CxO):** Up to **$500,000**.
* **CEO/CFO:** **$500,000+** and all M&A/Real Estate documents.

## Common Deal Blockers
To speed up your contract, ensure these are addressed *before* submitting to legal:
1.  **Auto-Renewal:** We generally reject "Auto-Renewal with 90-day notice." Negotiate for "Auto-Renewal with right to terminate for convenience."
2.  **Payment Terms:** Standard is **Net 45**. Terms shorter than Net 30 require Finance VP approval.
3.  **Limitation of Liability:** We cap liability at 12 months of fees. Unlimited liability is a hard "No."

## 6. Prohibited Contract Terms

The following terms are categorically prohibited and will cause Legal to reject the contract outright. Do not attempt to negotiate these without EVP approval.

### Red Flag Clauses
* **Indemnification for IP Infringement (Vendor Paper):** If the vendor's contract requires us to indemnify THEM for intellectual property claims, reject it.
* **Uncapped Liability:** We will not accept unlimited liability exposure. Our standard cap is 12 months of fees paid.
* **Governing Law Outside Delaware/New York:** Foreign governing law (especially arbitration in vendor's home country) requires General Counsel approval.
* **Right to Audit Our Systems:** We do not permit vendor audit rights that would compromise our security or expose us to liability.
* **Non-Disparagement:** We will not sign clauses that restrict our ability to provide truthful feedback or reviews.

### Negotiation Tips
If a vendor insists on problematic terms:
1. **Reciprocal Language:** Propose that the clause apply equally to both parties
2. **Carve-Outs:** Narrow the scope (e.g., "Limitation of liability does not apply to breaches of confidentiality")
3. **Insurance:** Request proof of insurance covering the vendor's obligations

### 11.3 Acquisition-Related Contracts

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Do I need Legal review for a contract renewal with no changes?**
A: If the terms, pricing, and scope are identical, you may approve via the renewal workflow without Legal review. If anything has changed, submit for review.

**Q2: A vendor is pressuring me to sign their standard agreement immediately. What should I do?**
A: Do not sign vendor paper without Legal review. Explain that company policy prohibits it. If the vendor refuses to wait, escalate to your VP.

**Q3: Can I negotiate contract terms directly with the vendor before involving Legal?**
A: Yes, for commercial terms (price, delivery dates, quantities). Do not negotiate legal terms (liability, indemnification, IP) without Legal's guidance.

**Q4: The vendor sent a 40-page contract. Will Legal review every page?**
A: Yes. Legal reviews all contract pages, focusing on liability, IP, data privacy, termination, and payment terms. This is why advance notice is critical.

**Q5: Can I use an electronic signature tool other than DocuSign?**
A: No. DocuSign is our approved e-signature platform for compliance and audit purposes. Signatures via email PDF or HelloSign are not acceptable.

**Q6: What happens if I sign a contract without proper approval?**
A: The contract may be voidable (unenforceable), and you may face disciplinary action. The company is not bound by unauthorized signatures.

**Q7: A vendor is requesting our W-9 form. Can I send it?**
A: Yes, but verify the request is legitimate. Forward vendor information to ap@company.com and they will send the W-9 directly to avoid phishing scams.

**Q8: How do I find out who has signature authority in my department?**
A: Check the Signature Authority Matrix in Ironclad or ask your finance business partner. When in doubt, route the contract through the standard workflow.

**Q9: Can I accept a vendor's "clickwrap" terms for free trial software?**
A: For free trials under 30 days with no data input, yes. For longer trials or if you'll upload customer/employee data, submit for Legal review first.

**Q10: What if a vendor refuses to negotiate and insists on their standard terms?**
A: Legal will assess the risk. For low-value, low-risk purchases, we may accept vendor terms with documented exceptions. For critical services, we will require our standard terms or walk away.

**Q11: How long should we keep signed contracts?**
A: Contracts are retained electronically in Ironclad for 7 years post-expiration per the company retention policy. Do not store contracts locally or in email.

**Q12: Can I share a signed contract with a vendor via email?**
A: Yes, but only send to authorized vendor representatives. Do not share via unencrypted channels. Use DocuSign or Ironclad's secure sharing features.

## 15. Escalation Process

If a contract review is taking longer than the stated SLA:

**Level 1:** Post in Slack #legal-helpdesk with contract ID
**Level 2:** Email contracts@company.com with your manager CC'd
**Level 3:** Email General Counsel (if business-critical and stalled >10 days)

**Before Escalating:**
* Verify all required information was provided
* Check Ironclad for pending action items assigned to you
* Confirm the clock has actually exceeded the SLA (it pauses when waiting for your input)

## 16. Audit and Compliance

### 16.1 Contract Audits
Finance and Internal Audit periodically review contracts to ensure:
* Signature authority was followed
* Proper approvals were obtained
* Spend matches approved budgets
* Vendor performance meets SLA requirements

### 16.2 Vendor Performance Reviews
Business owners must complete annual vendor performance reviews in Ironclad for contracts >$50k. Metrics include:
* Service quality and reliability
* Responsiveness to issues
* Adherence to contract terms
* Pricing competitiveness

Poor-performing vendors will be flagged for non-renewal or renegotiation.
