# Contract Review and Approval Process

**System:** Ironclad (CLM)
**Signature Tool:** DocuSign

## Overview
No employee is authorized to sign a contract on behalf of the company unless they hold specific delegated authority (see "Signature Authority" below). All contracts must go through the Legal Review Workflow.

## Review Thresholds and SLAs

| Contract Type | Value (Annual) | Legal Review Required? | SLA (Turnaround) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NDA (Standard)** | N/A | No (Self-Service) | Instant |
| **Sales Order (Standard)** | Any | No (VP Sales Approval only) | Instant |
| **Vendor Contract** | < $10k | Optional (Manager Discretion) | 3 Business Days |
| **Vendor Contract** | $10k - $100k | **Yes** | 5 Business Days |
| **Vendor Contract** | > $100k | **Yes + CFO Approval** | 7-10 Business Days |
| **Software/SaaS** | Any | **Yes (Security & Privacy Review)** | 7-10 Business Days |

## The Review Process steps

### 1. Intake
* Upload the PDF/Word draft to Ironclad.
* Fill out the "Cover Sheet" (Deal value, renewal terms, business owner).
* **Crucial:** You must attach the **Security Review Approval** (from IT) if the vendor handles customer data.

### 2. Triage
* The Legal Operations Manager assigns the contract to a Counsel based on the department (e.g., Commercial, Marketing, Product).

### 3. Redlining
* Legal negotiates terms directly with the counterparty's counsel.
* *Note:* Business owners are responsible for negotiating **Commercial Terms** (Price, Quantity, Service Level), not Legal.

### 4. Signature
* Once terms are final, Legal "Unlocks" the document in Ironclad.
* The document is routed via DocuSign to the appropriate signer based on the Authority Matrix below.

## Signature Authority Matrix
*Who signs the dotted line?*

* **Individual Contributors / Managers:** $0 Authority. Cannot sign.
* **Directors:** Up to **$25,000**.
* **VPs:** Up to **$100,000**.
* **C-Level (CxO):** Up to **$500,000**.
* **CEO/CFO:** **$500,000+** and all M&A/Real Estate documents.

## Common Deal Blockers
To speed up your contract, ensure these are addressed *before* submitting to legal:
1.  **Auto-Renewal:** We generally reject "Auto-Renewal with 90-day notice." Negotiate for "Auto-Renewal with right to terminate for convenience."
2.  **Payment Terms:** Standard is **Net 45**. Terms shorter than Net 30 require Finance VP approval.
3.  **Limitation of Liability:** We cap liability at 12 months of fees. Unlimited liability is a hard "No."
