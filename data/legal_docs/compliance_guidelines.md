This Regulatory Compliance Guidelines document establishes the framework for ethical business conduct and regulatory adherence across all company operations.

## 2. Anti-Bribery & Corruption (FCPA/UK Bribery Act)

The company strictly prohibits offering, giving, soliciting, or accepting bribes under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), UK Bribery Act, and local anti-corruption laws.

* **De Minimis Exception:** Promotional items under $25 (pens, calendars, coffee mugs) do not require disclosure

### 2.3 Facilitation Payments
Facilitation payments (small bribes to expedite routine government actions like visa processing) are **prohibited globally**, even in jurisdictions where they may be customary. If pressured to make such payments, contact Legal immediately.

### 2.4 Third-Party Due Diligence
Before engaging agents, distributors, or consultants in high-risk jurisdictions, complete the **Third-Party Due Diligence Questionnaire** available in the Compliance Portal. High-risk regions include countries with Corruption Perceptions Index scores below 50.

## 3. Insider Trading Policy

If you possess Material Non-Public Information (MNPI), you may not trade company stock, tip others, or recommend purchases/sales.

### 3.1 What Constitutes MNPI
Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would consider it important when deciding to buy, hold, or sell securities. Examples include:
* Unannounced earnings results or financial forecasts
* Pending mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures
* Major customer wins or losses
* Regulatory actions or litigation outcomes
* Changes in executive leadership
* Cybersecurity breaches affecting customer data
* Bankruptcy or going-concern issues

### 3.2 Trading Windows
* **Open Window:** The trading window opens **2 full trading days** after the public release of quarterly earnings and closes **14 days** before the end of the next fiscal quarter
* **Example:** If Q3 earnings are released on October 25th at 4:00 PM ET, the window opens on October 27th at market open
* **Earnings Calendar:** Published annually by Investor Relations; available on the intranet

### 3.3 Blackout Periods
All Finance, Legal, and Executive Staff are automatically placed on blackout lists during sensitive periods. You will be notified via email if this applies to you.

**Additional Restrictions:**
* **Pre-Clearance Required:** Directors and above must pre-clear all trades with the General Counsel at least 2 business days in advance
* **Holding Period:** Shares acquired through stock options must be held for at least 6 months before sale

### 3.4 Consequences of Violations
Insider trading is a criminal offense punishable by:
* Civil penalties up to 3x the profit gained or loss avoided
* Criminal fines up to $5 million for individuals
* Imprisonment up to 20 years
* Immediate termination and disgorgement of all equity compensation

## 4. Whistleblower Protection

We maintain a "Non-Retaliation" policy aligned with Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 806 and Dodd-Frank whistleblower provisions.

### 4.1 Reporting Channels
If you suspect financial fraud, harassment, discrimination, safety violations, or ethical misconduct, report it via:
* **EthicsPoint Portal:** ethics.company.com (available 24/7 in 15 languages)
* **Whistleblower Hotline:** 1-800-555-0123 (Anonymous reporting available)
* **Direct Escalation:** compliance@company.com or your HRBP

### 4.2 What to Report
Examples of reportable conduct:
* Accounting fraud or financial statement manipulation
* Misuse of company assets or embezzlement
* Discrimination, harassment, or workplace violence
* Violations of environmental, health, or safety regulations
* Cybersecurity incidents or data breaches
* Conflicts of interest not properly disclosed
* Retaliation against other whistleblowers

### 4.3 Retaliation Protection
Retaliation against an employee for making a good-faith report is grounds for immediate termination of the retaliator. Protected activities include:
* Filing a complaint internally or with government agencies
* Participating in investigations
* Testifying in legal proceedings

**Note:** "Good faith" means you reasonably believed the information was true, even if an investigation proves it unfounded. False reports made knowingly and with malicious intent are not protected.

### 4.4 Investigation Process
1. **Intake:** Compliance team acknowledges receipt within 24 hours
2. **Assessment:** Preliminary review within 5 business days to determine severity
3. **Investigation:** Typically completed within 30 days; complex cases may extend to 60 days
4. **Resolution:** Reporter receives confidential update (if contact information provided)

## 5. Conflicts of Interest

Employees must act in the best interest of the company and avoid situations where personal interests conflict with company interests.

### 5.1 Common Conflict Scenarios

#### Outside Employment and Side Businesses
* **Disclosure Required:** You must disclose any side business that competes with, supplies, or partners with the company
* **Prohibited:** Working for a direct competitor, even in unrelated roles

#### Family and Personal Relationships
* **Hiring Restrictions:** You cannot hire, supervise, or influence compensation decisions for immediate family members (spouse, domestic partner, children, siblings, parents)

* **Dating Policy:** Romantic relationships between supervisors and direct reports must be disclosed to HR within 10 days; reporting structure will be modified

#### Financial Interests

* **Customer Investments:** Sales personnel may not hold significant equity positions in their assigned accounts
* **Board Positions:** Serving on outside boards requires EVP approval

### 5.2 Annual Disclosure Process
* **Deadline:** All employees must update their Conflict of Interest disclosure annually by **January 31st** via Workday

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Can I accept a $150 dinner invitation from a vendor?**
A: Only if you have no pending decisions involving that vendor and you obtain your manager's approval in advance. Disclose it in the Compliance Portal within 5 days.

**Q2: I overheard a competitor discussing their pricing strategy at a conference reception. What should I do?**
A: Do not engage in the conversation. Leave immediately and send an email to compliance@company.com documenting what you heard and that you disengaged.

**Q3: My spouse works for a company that might become a customer. Is that a conflict?**
A: Potentially. Disclose it immediately to your manager and HR. You will likely be recused from any sales or contract activities involving that company.

**Q4: I accidentally received a competitor's confidential pricing spreadsheet via email. What should I do?**
A: Do not open attachments or forward it. Delete it immediately and notify legal@company.com. Document the incident.

**Q5: Can I trade company stock if I work in Marketing and don't have access to financial data?**
A: You may trade during open trading windows, but if you become aware of MNPI through meetings or casual conversations, you are still prohibited from trading.

**Q6: What happens if I report a violation and it turns out to be unfounded?**
A: If you reported in good faith (you reasonably believed it was true), you are fully protected from retaliation even if the investigation concludes no violation occurred.

**Q7: A government official asked for a "consulting fee" to expedite our permit. Is this allowed?**
A: No. This is a bribe. Do not make the payment. Escalate to legal@company.com immediately.

**Q8: Our team wants to take a client to an expensive sporting event ($300/ticket). Is this allowed?**
A: Entertainment over $200 per person requires VP approval. Submit a request through the Compliance Portal before purchasing tickets. Ensure the purpose is clearly business-related, not purely social.

**Q9: I'm in Finance and want to sell some stock during the blackout period due to a family emergency. Is there an exception?**
A: Possibly. Contact the General Counsel to request a "hardship exemption" under Rule 10b5-1. You must demonstrate urgent financial need unrelated to company performance.

**Q10: How do I know if a counterparty is a government official?**
A: If they work for an organization that is more than 50% government-owned or controlled, treat them as a government official. This includes state-owned telecom companies, hospitals, and universities. When in doubt, ask Legal.
