## Overview
This policy outlines the vacation and personal time benefits for all full-time salaried employees. We believe that rest and recuperation are essential to productivity and mental health. This policy combines vacation and personal time into a single "PTO" bucket, providing maximum flexibility for employees to use their time off as they see fit.

## Policy Philosophy
At our company, we recognize that work-life balance is not just a benefit—it's a business imperative. Research consistently shows that well-rested employees are more productive, creative, and engaged. Our PTO policy is designed to:

* **Promote Mental and Physical Health:** Regular breaks from work reduce burnout and stress-related illness
* **Foster Work-Life Integration:** Combining vacation and personal time eliminates the need to justify the reason for time off
* **Support Diverse Needs:** A flexible PTO system accommodates different cultural observances, family needs, and personal preferences
* **Build Trust:** We trust our employees to manage their time responsibly without micromanagement
* **Encourage Usage:** Unlike "unlimited PTO" policies that often result in employees taking less time off, our accrual system ensures employees understand and utilize their earned benefits

### Legal Compliance
This policy has been designed to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to:
* Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
* Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
* State-specific paid sick leave laws (CA, NY, MA, WA, etc.)
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations

## Accrual Schedule
PTO accrues on a per-pay-period basis (semi-monthly). Accruals begin on the employee's first day of employment.

### Tier 1: 0–2 Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 15 days (120 hours)
* **Monthly Accrual Rate:** 1.25 days (10 hours) per month
* **Per Pay Period:** 5 hours

### Tier 2: 3–5 Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 20 days (160 hours)
* **Monthly Accrual Rate:** 1.67 days (13.36 hours) per month
* **Per Pay Period:** 6.68 hours

### Tier 3: 5+ Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 25 days (200 hours)
* **Monthly Accrual Rate:** 2.08 days (16.64 hours) per month
* **Per Pay Period:** 8.32 hours

## Usage and Request Process
1.  **System:** All requests must be logged in **Workday**.
2.  **Advance Notice:**
    * **1-2 Days off:** Request at least 24 hours in advance.
    * **3+ Days off:** Request at least 2 weeks in advance.
3.  **Manager Approval:** Managers are required to approve or deny requests within **3 business days**. If no action is taken, the request is auto-escalated to HR.

### Negative Balance
Employees may borrow up to **40 hours (5 days)** of PTO against future accruals with manager approval. If employment terminates with a negative balance, the value will be deducted from the final paycheck.

## Carryover and Cap
* **Carryover Limit:** You may carry over a maximum of **5 days (40 hours)** into the next calendar year.
* **Expiration:** Carried-over hours must be used by **March 31st** of the following year, or they will be forfeited.
* **Total Cap:** Once an employee reaches 1.5x their annual allotment in their bank, accruals stop until time is used.

## Sick Leave
*Note: Sick leave is tracked separately from PTO to comply with state laws.*
* **Annual Allotment:** 10 days (80 hours) per year for all employees regardless of tenure.
* **Usage:** Can be used for personal illness, doctor appointments, or caring for an immediate family member.
* **Doctor's Note:** Required for sick leave exceeding **3 consecutive business days**.

## Holidays
The company observes the following **11 paid holidays**:
1.  New Year's Day
2.  Martin Luther King Jr. Day
3.  President's Day
4.  Memorial Day
5.  Juneteenth
6.  Independence Day
7.  Labor Day
8.  Thanksgiving Day
9.  Day after Thanksgiving
10. Christmas Eve
11. Christmas Day

## Blackout Periods
PTO requests for more than 1 day may be restricted during the following critical business periods:
* **Finance Dept:** First 5 business days of every quarter (Close period).
* **Sales Dept:** Final 2 weeks of the Fiscal Year (Dec 15 - Dec 31).
* **All Company:** During the Annual Summit (usually 2nd week of February).

## Separation and Payout
Upon termination of employment (voluntary or involuntary):
* **Accrued PTO:** Paid out at 100% of the employee's current hourly rate.
* **Sick Leave:** Not paid out upon termination, unless required by specific state law (e.g., California).

## Special Circumstances

### Part-Time Employees
Part-time employees (20-39 hours/week) receive prorated PTO based on their scheduled hours:
* **20-29 hours/week:** 60% of full-time accrual rate
* **30-39 hours/week:** 75% of full-time accrual rate
* Part-time employees must work a minimum of 1,000 hours annually to be eligible for PTO benefits

### Leave of Absence (LOA) Impact
PTO accruals are affected by unpaid leaves as follows:
* **FMLA/Medical Leave:** Accruals continue for the first 30 days, then pause until return to active employment
* **Personal Leave of Absence:** Accruals pause immediately upon LOA start date
* **Military Leave:** Accruals continue in accordance with USERRA requirements
* **Jury Duty/Bereavement:** No impact on accruals; these are separate from PTO

### Mergers and Acquisitions
In the event of a company merger or acquisition:
* All accrued PTO balances transfer to the new entity
* Employees retain their original hire date for tenure calculation purposes
* If the acquiring company has a less generous PTO policy, employees will be grandfathered into the current policy for 24 months

### Sabbatical Program
Employees with 7+ years of continuous service are eligible for a one-time sabbatical:
* **Duration:** 4 weeks (160 hours) of paid time off
* **Requirements:** Must use within 12 months of eligibility; requires 90 days advance notice
* **Accruals:** PTO continues to accrue during sabbatical
* **Purpose:** Intended for extended travel, personal projects, or volunteer work
* **Application:** Submit sabbatical request form to HR with manager approval

### State-Specific Variations
#### California Employees
* PTO is considered earned wages and cannot expire or be forfeited
* No "use it or lose it" provision; all PTO must be paid out at termination
* Sick leave is tracked separately and accrues at 1 hour per 30 hours worked (minimum)

#### New York Employees
* Entitled to additional sick leave under NY Paid Sick Leave Law
* Total sick leave allotment: 10 company days + 5 state-mandated days = 15 days

#### Washington Employees
* Entitled to Paid Sick and Safe Time (PSST) under state law
* May use sick leave for reasons related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking

### Religious and Cultural Observances
We respect the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds of our employees:
* Employees may use PTO for any religious or cultural observance
* Requests for time off during major religious holidays (Diwali, Eid, Rosh Hashanah, etc.) receive priority approval
* Managers should consult the "Religious Observance Calendar" in Workday when scheduling team meetings or deadlines
* Employees may request floating holidays in lieu of company holidays that don't align with their observances

### Remote Employee Considerations
Remote employees working across time zones should note:
* PTO is tracked based on employee's local time zone
* For WFH employees in countries outside the US, PTO may be subject to local labor laws
* International remote workers should consult the "Global Employment Guide" for country-specific policies

## FAQ

### General Questions
**Q: Can I take half-days?**
A: Yes, Workday allows you to request PTO in 4-hour increments. You can take a half-day in the morning (8am-12pm) or afternoon (12pm-4pm).

**Q: Does PTO accrue while I am on unpaid leave?**
A: No, accruals are paused during any unpaid leave of absence exceeding 30 days. However, accruals continue during the first 30 days of FMLA leave.

**Q: I have a planned vacation before I start. Can I take it?**
A: Yes, provided this was disclosed during the offer stage and your manager approved it in writing. You may take it unpaid if you haven't accrued enough hours, or you may borrow against future accruals with manager approval.

**Q: What happens if a company holiday falls during my PTO?**
A: The holiday is not charged against your PTO balance. For example, if you take PTO from July 1-5 and July 4th is Independence Day, you'll only be charged for 4 days of PTO (July 1, 2, 3, and 5).

**Q: Can my manager deny my PTO request?**
A: Managers may deny requests based on business needs, but they must provide a written explanation and suggest alternative dates within 30 days of the original request. Repeated denials without valid justification should be escalated to HR.

**Q: Do I need to provide a reason for my PTO request?**
A: No. PTO is yours to use as you see fit. You are not required to disclose whether you're taking a vacation, attending a personal appointment, or simply need a mental health day.

### Accrual and Balance Questions
**Q: How do I check my current PTO balance?**
A: Log into Workday > Select "Time Off" > View "Balance" tab. Balances update within 24 hours of each pay period close.

**Q: What is my accrual rate if I'm promoted?**
A: Promotions do not affect PTO accrual rates. Only your total tenure with the company determines your tier.

**Q: I just hit 3 years of tenure. When does my accrual rate increase?**
A: Your accrual rate increases on the first day of the pay period following your anniversary date. For example, if your anniversary is June 10th and pay periods close on the 15th and last day of the month, your new rate takes effect June 16th.

**Q: Can I donate PTO to a coworker in need?**
A: Yes, we have a PTO Donation Program for employees facing catastrophic illness or family emergencies. Contact HR to initiate a donation or request donated time.

### Request and Approval Process
**Q: My manager hasn't responded to my PTO request. What do I do?**
A: Managers have 3 business days to respond. After 3 days, the request is automatically escalated to HR and the skip-level manager. You'll receive an auto-notification if this occurs.

**Q: Can I cancel a PTO request after it's been approved?**
A: Yes, you can cancel in Workday up to 24 hours before the PTO start date. The hours will be returned to your balance immediately.

**Q: What if I get sick during my vacation?**
A: If you experience a serious illness or injury during scheduled PTO that would qualify for sick leave, you may submit a request to convert those PTO days to sick leave. A doctor's note is required for conversions of 3+ days.

**Q: Do I need to check email or Slack during PTO?**
A: No. PTO is meant to be uninterrupted time away from work. Set your Slack status to "Out of Office" and enable Workday's automatic email responder. Your manager should reassign urgent tasks before your PTO begins.

### Payout and Separation Questions
**Q: How is my PTO payout calculated when I leave the company?**
A: Accrued PTO is paid at your current base hourly rate (annual salary ÷ 2,080 hours). It's included in your final paycheck and subject to normal tax withholdings.

**Q: What if I'm terminated during my negative PTO balance period?**
A: The borrowed hours will be deducted from your final paycheck. If your final paycheck doesn't cover the full balance, you'll receive an invoice for the remaining amount owed.

**Q: Does unused sick leave get paid out?**
A: Not in most states. However, California requires payout of unused sick leave. Consult the "State Leave Laws" document in Workday for specifics.

### Technical Issues
**Q: The Workday system won't let me submit my PTO request. What's wrong?**
A: Common issues include:
* Insufficient balance (check your accrued vs. requested hours)
* Request date is in the past
* Manager has not been assigned in Workday
* System maintenance window (Sundays 2am-6am ET)
Contact it-support@company.com if the issue persists.

**Q: I see two different PTO balances—one in Workday and one in my pay stub. Which is correct?**
A: The Workday balance is always the source of truth. Pay stub balances may be delayed by one pay cycle. If there's a discrepancy beyond one pay period, contact payroll@company.com.
