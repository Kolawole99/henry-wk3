## Overview
This policy outlines the vacation and personal time benefits for all full-time salaried employees. We believe that rest and recuperation are essential to productivity and mental health. This policy combines vacation and personal time into a single "PTO" bucket.

## Accrual Schedule
PTO accrues on a per-pay-period basis (semi-monthly). Accruals begin on the employee's first day of employment.

### Tier 1: 0–2 Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 15 days (120 hours)
* **Monthly Accrual Rate:** 1.25 days (10 hours) per month
* **Per Pay Period:** 5 hours

### Tier 2: 3–5 Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 20 days (160 hours)

* **Per Pay Period:** 6.68 hours

### Tier 3: 5+ Years of Tenure
* **Annual Allotment:** 25 days (200 hours)
