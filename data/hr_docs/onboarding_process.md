## Overview
This document outlines the mandatory steps for onboarding new employees. The standard onboarding period is considered the first **90 days** of employment.

## FAQ
**Q: My laptop hasn't arrived by Day 1. What do I do?**
A: Contact it-support@company.com immediately. You may join orientation via personal device, but do not download work files.

**Q: When do I get my first paycheck?**
A: We pay semi-monthly on the **15th and last day** of the month. If you start fewer than 5 days before a pay date, your first check will be included in the *following* cycle.

## Phase 7: 30-60-90 Day Check-Ins

### 30-Day Check-In (Employee + Manager + HR)

  * What's going well?
  * What's confusing or unclear?
  * Do you have the tools and access you need?

* **Benefits:** All benefits (if not yet vested) become fully active
* **Compensation:** Eligible for next merit cycle and bonus programs

## Onboarding Metrics and Success Criteria

We track onboarding success through:
* **Time to Productivity:** Average days until first meaningful contribution (goal: <30 days for individual contributors, <60 days for managers)
* **90-Day Retention:** % of new hires still employed after 90 days (goal: >95%)
* **New Hire Satisfaction:** Survey score (goal: 4.5+ out of 5)
* **Manager Satisfaction:** Manager rates onboarding support (goal: 4.3+ out of 5)

## Special Onboarding Scenarios

### International Employees (via EOR)
* Onboarding follows similar process but coordinated through our Employer of Record (Deel or Remote.com)
* Benefits enrollment happens through EOR platform, not Workday
* Country-specific compliance training added (e.g., GDPR for EU employees, OH&S for Australia)
* Time zone considerations: Async onboarding materials available; live sessions recorded

### Intern Onboarding
* **Duration:** 10-12 weeks (summer) or 16 weeks (co-op)
* **Simplified Process:** No benefits enrollment (interns not eligible)
* **Mentorship:** Each intern assigned a mentor (non-manager peer)
* **Project:** Defined project with clear deliverable by end of internship
* **Evaluation:** Final presentation to team + written evaluation for academic credit

### Executive Onboarding
* **Extended Timeline:** 6-month onboarding process (vs. 90 days)
* **Strategic Immersion:** Meetings with all department heads in first 30 days
* **Board Introduction:** Attend first Board Meeting (observer status) within 60 days
* **External Introductions:** PR/Comms coordinates customer and partner introductions
* **Executive Coach:** Company provides executive coaching (6 sessions in first year)

### Rehires ("Boomerangs")
* **Expedited Process:** IT systems may still have records; faster provisioning
* **Abbreviated Training:** Skip redundant training (e.g., company history, values)
* **Tenure Credit:** Depending on gap, previous tenure may count toward PTO accrual tier
* **No Probationary Period:** If previous tenure >1 year and left in good standing
