**Systems Used:** Lattice

## Review Cycle Timeline

### Mid-Year Check-in (July)
* **Focus:** Developmental. No formal ratings or compensation adjustments.
* **Action:** Manager and Employee review progress on annual goals. Adjust goals if business priorities have shifted.
* **Outcome:** "On Track" or "Off Track" status recorded.

### End-of-Year Review (January)
* **Focus:** Evaluation, Compensation, and Promotion.
* **Timeline:**
    * **Jan 1-10:** Self-Review (Employee writes assessment).
    * **Jan 11-20:** Peer Reviews (3-5 peers selected).
    * **Jan 21-31:** Manager Review & Rating.
    * **Feb 1-7:** Calibration Sessions (Leadership aligns on ratings).
    * **Feb 15:** Packets delivered to employees.

## Rating Scale
We use a 5-point scale to evaluate performance:

1.  **Does Not Meet Expectations:** Consistently misses goals; immediate improvement required.
2.  **Developing:** Misses some goals or is new to the role ( < 6 months).
3.  **Meets Expectations:** Consistently hits goals; a solid performer (approx. 50% of staff).
4.  **Exceeds Expectations:** Frequently goes above and beyond; high impact.
5.  **Distinguished:** Redefines the role; top 5% of company performance.

## Promotion Criteria
Promotions are considered only during the End-of-Year cycle. To be eligible:
1.  **Rating:** Must receive a **4 (Exceeds)** or **5 (Distinguished)**.
2.  **Tenure:** Generally requires **12+ months** in current role.
3.  **Business Need:** There must be a business case for the role level increase.
4.  **Scope:** The employee must already be demonstrating 70% of the responsibilities of the next level.

## Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
If an employee receives a **1 (Does Not Meet)** rating or is underperforming mid-cycle:
1.  **Drafting:** Manager drafts a PIP with specific, measurable goals and a timeline (usually 30 or 60 days).
2.  **HR Review:** HR Partner reviews for fairness and clarity.
3.  **Delivery:** Manager presents PIP.
4.  **Outcome:** Success leads to removal from PIP. Failure leads to termination of employment.

## Compensation Adjustments
* **Merit Increases:** Based on the Rating (1-5) and position in salary band.
* **Market Adjustments:** HR reviews salary bands annually against [Radford/OptionImpact] data. Adjustments happen automatically if an employee falls below 80% of the market rate for their role.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I request an off-cycle promotion?**
A: Off-cycle promotions are rare and require CEO approval. They are usually reserved for retention of critical talent or significant role changes.

**Q: Who sees my peer reviews?**
A: Your manager sees the names and content. You (the employee) see the content but it is **anonymized** to encourage honesty.
