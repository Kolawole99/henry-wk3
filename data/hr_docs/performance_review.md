### Phase-by-Phase Detailed Instructions

#### Phase 1: Self-Review (Jan 1-10)
Employees must complete a comprehensive self-assessment addressing:

**Required Sections:**
1. **Goal Achievement** (50% of assessment)
   * For each goal, provide:
     - Completion status (0-100%)
     - Specific accomplishments with metrics
     - Challenges encountered
     - Impact on business objectives

2. **Core Competencies** (30% of assessment)
   * Rate yourself on company values:
     - Customer Focus
     - Innovation and Agility
     - Collaboration
     - Ownership and Accountability
     - Inclusive Leadership
   * Provide 2-3 examples per competency

3. **Development and Growth** (20% of assessment)
   * Skills acquired this year
   * Training completed
   * Areas for future development
   * Career aspirations

**Tips for Effective Self-Reviews:**
* Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
* Include quantifiable metrics wherever possible
* Be honest about challenges; growth areas are expected
* Save drafts frequently; system times out after 30 minutes of inactivity
* Request examples from colleagues if memory is unclear

---

#### Phase 2-3: Peer Reviews (Jan 11-20)

**Peer Selection Guidelines:**
* **Minimum:** 3 peers | **Maximum:** 5 peers
* **Composition:** Mix of direct collaborators, cross-functional partners, and at least one from outside your immediate team
* **Restrictions:** Cannot nominate your direct manager or direct reports
* **Manager Override:** Managers may add or remove peer nominees to ensure balanced perspective

**For Peer Reviewers:**

When you receive a peer review request, you have **5 business days** to complete it. The survey includes:

1. What has this person done exceptionally well this year?
2. What is one area where they could improve or develop?
3. How effectively do they collaborate with others? (1-5 scale)
4. Would you want to work with this person again on future projects? (Yes/No/Neutral)
5. Additional comments (optional)

**Peer Review Best Practices:**
* Be specific and provide examples
* Focus on behaviors, not personality traits
* Balance positive feedback with constructive suggestions
* Avoid vague statements like "does good work"
* Remember: Your feedback is **anonymized** to the recipient but visible to their manager

**Confidentiality Notice:**
Discussing your peer review responses with the subject is discouraged, as it undermines the anonymization process and may inhibit honest feedback.

---

#### Phase 4: Calibration Sessions (Feb 1-7)

**Purpose:** Ensure fairness, consistency, and eliminate bias in ratings across the organization.

**Participants:**
* All people managers within a department
* Department VP or Senior Director (facilitator)
* HR Business Partner (observer and advisor)
* Optional: Skip-level leadership for contested cases

**Process:**
1. **Pre-Calibration:** Managers submit their proposed ratings and brief justification (3-5 bullets) 24 hours in advance
2. **Distribution Review:** HR presents the department's proposed rating distribution against company targets
3. **Case Review:** Managers present borderline cases (between two ratings)
4. **Peer Discussion:** The group discusses and challenges ratings using objective criteria
5. **Adjustment:** Ratings are raised or lowered based on comparative discussion
6. **Final Lock:** VP approves the final distribution

**Target Rating Distribution:**
The company aims for the following distribution across the organization:
* **Rating 5 (Distinguished):** 5-7% of employees
* **Rating 4 (Exceeds):** 20-25% of employees
* **Rating 3 (Meets):** 55-60% of employees
* **Rating 2 (Developing):** 8-10% of employees
* **Rating 1 (Does Not Meet):** 2-3% of employees

**Note:** These are guidelines, not quotas. Small teams (<10 people) may deviate from these percentages.

---

## Rating Scale and Definitions

We use a **5-point performance rating scale**. Each rating has specific criteria and behavioral indicators.

### Rating 5: Distinguished Performance
**Definition:** Consistently performs at a level that far exceeds all expectations. Operates at the next level or beyond. Recognized across the organization as a top performer.

**Indicators:**
* Achieved 100%+ of all goals with exceptional results
* Delivered outcomes that significantly exceeded scope or impact
* Demonstrates mastery of role and consistently performs work beyond current level

* Receives unsolicited praise from senior leadership or external stakeholders

**Typical Outcomes:**
* Eligible for promotion (with tenure requirements met)
* Merit increase: 8-12% above base salary
* Eligible for spot bonuses or equity refresh grants
* Priority consideration for high-visibility projects

**Percentage of Workforce:** ~5-7%

**Example Narrative:**
> "Jordan exceeded all goals by an average of 140% and delivered the company's first AI-powered customer analytics dashboard three months ahead of schedule, resulting in $2M in identified revenue opportunities. Jordan mentored three junior engineers and presented our technical approach at two industry conferences, raising the company's profile in the marketplace. Performance consistently operates at Senior Staff level despite being in a Staff role."

---

### Rating 4: Exceeds Expectations
**Definition:** Frequently exceeds expectations and makes significant contributions beyond core responsibilities.

**Indicators:**
* Achieved 100% of goals with at least one area of exceptional performance
* Delivered work ahead of schedule or significantly exceeded quality standards
* Took on stretch projects or additional responsibilities successfully
* Positively influences team performance
* Demonstrates all core competencies at high level

**Typical Outcomes:**
* May be eligible for promotion with additional tenure/scope
* Merit increase: 5-7% above base salary
* Eligible for performance bonus
* First consideration for developmental opportunities

**Percentage of Workforce:** ~20-25%

---

### Rating 3: Meets Expectations

* Delivers quality work on time
* Demonstrates all core competencies at expected level
* Collaborates effectively with team
* Addresses feedback and shows growth

**Typical Outcomes:**
* Not typically eligible for promotion without significant scope increase
* Merit increase: 2-4% above base salary
* Remains in good standing
* Eligible for standard training and development

**Percentage of Workforce:** ~55-60%

**Important Note:**
A "Meets Expectations" rating is **positive** and reflects successful performance. The majority of our workforce receives this rating. It is not a warning sign or indication of underperformance.

---

### Rating 2: Developing
**Definition:** Performance is below expectations but shows potential for improvement. May be new to role or facing specific challenges.

**Indicators:**
* Achieved 60-84% of goals
* Misses deadlines or quality standards in some areas
* New to role (< 6 months) and still ramping
* Demonstrates some but not all core competencies

**Typical Outcomes:**
* Not eligible for promotion
* Merit increase: 0-2% (typically market adjustments only)
* Mandatory development plan with 90-day check-ins
* Increased manager support and coaching
* If sustained for 2+ cycles, may lead to PIP

**Percentage of Workforce:** ~8-10%

**For New Employees:**
A "Developing" rating in your first full review cycle is common and not penalizing. The focus is on growth trajectory.

---

### Rating 1: Does Not Meet Expectations
**Definition:** Performance is significantly below expectations. Immediate and substantial improvement is required.

**Indicators:**
* Achieved less than 60% of goals

---

## Goal Setting Framework

Effective performance management begins with clear, measurable goals. We use the **OKR (Objectives and Key Results)** framework aligned with SMART principles.

### Goal Components

Each employee should have **3-5 major goals** for the year, comprising:

**1. Business Goals (60-70% weight)**
* Directly tied to department or company OKRs
* Measurable outcomes that impact revenue, efficiency, or customer satisfaction
* Example: "Increase customer retention rate from 82% to 88% by Q4"

**2. Growth/Development Goals (20-30% weight)**
* Skills acquisition, certifications, or role expansion
* Example: "Complete AWS Solutions Architect certification and apply learnings to infrastructure redesign project"

**3. Values/Culture Goals (10-20% weight)**
* Contributions to company culture, mentorship, or cross-team collaboration
* Example: "Mentor two junior team members and document three knowledge-sharing resources for the team wiki"

### SMART Goal Criteria

Every goal must be:
* **Specific:** Clearly defined outcome, not vague aspirations
* **Measurable:** Includes metrics or completion criteria
* **Achievable:** Challenging but attainable with available resources
* **Relevant:** Aligned to business strategy and role expectations
* **Time-bound:** Has clear deadline or milestone dates

### Goal-Setting Process

**January (Week 1-2):**
1. Manager shares department OKRs and priorities
2. Employee drafts individual goals aligned to OKRs
3. Manager and employee meet to discuss and refine (60 min meeting)
4. Goals are entered into Lattice by January 15
5. HR reviews for quality and completeness

**Throughout the Year:**
* Goals can be adjusted during Mid-Year Check-in
* Manager can add/remove goals if major business pivot occurs (requires HR approval)
* Employees should update progress notes monthly in Lattice

### Example Goal Library

**Sales Role Example:**
```
Goal: Achieve $2.5M in new business bookings by December 31, 2024
Key Results:
- Close 15 new enterprise accounts (>$100k ACV)
- Maintain average sales cycle of 90 days or less
- Achieve 95% customer satisfaction score on post-sale surveys
Weight: 40%
```

**Engineering Role Example:**
```
Goal: Reduce API response time to improve platform performance
Key Results:
- Decrease P95 response time from 800ms to under 400ms
- Implement caching layer across 5 critical endpoints
- Zero production incidents related to performance degradation
Weight: 35%
```

## Promotion Criteria and Process

Promotions are a formal recognition of sustained exceptional performance and readiness for increased scope and responsibility.

### Timing and Eligibility

**Review Cycle:** Promotions are considered only during the **End-of-Year review cycle** (February).

**Minimum Eligibility Requirements:**
1. **Performance Rating:** Must receive a **4 (Exceeds Expectations)** or **5 (Distinguished)** in the current cycle
2. **Tenure in Role:** Minimum **12 months** in current level (exceptions require CEO approval)
3. **Performance History:** Consistent "Meets" or higher ratings for prior 2 years (if applicable)
4. **Scope Demonstration:** Already performing 70% of the responsibilities of the target level
5. **Business Need:** Open headcount or clear business justification for level increase

### The Promotion Framework

Our promotion philosophy is based on **demonstrating, not aspiring**. You must show you are already operating at the next level before being promoted to it.

**Promotion vs. Career Progression:**
* **Promotion:** Formal level change (e.g., Engineer II → Senior Engineer)
* **Career Progression:** Title change within same level band (e.g., Account Executive → Senior Account Executive)

### Promotion Process Steps

**Step 1: Manager Nomination (January)**
* Manager identifies promotion candidates based on criteria
* Completes "Promotion Justification Form" with specific evidence
* Submits to skip-level manager for preliminary review

**Step 2: Promotion Packet Development (Late January)**
The manager builds a comprehensive packet including:
* Performance summary (last 2 years if applicable)
* Specific examples of next-level work
* Peer testimonials (quotes from peer reviews)
* Scope comparison: current role vs. target role
* Business impact quantification

**Step 3: Calibration Review (February 1-7)**
* Promotion cases are discussed during calibration sessions
* Leadership evaluates against promotion criteria
* HR provides market data and internal equity analysis
* Cases are approved, deferred, or rejected

**Step 4: Approval Workflow (February 8-10)**
* Department VP approves
* HR reviews for compensation equity
* Finance approves budgetary impact
* CEO approves all promotions to Director level and above

**Step 5: Notification (February 15-22)**
* Approved promotions are communicated during performance review meeting
* Promotion effective date: March 1
* Compensation adjustment appears in March payroll
* Announcement shared with broader team (timing determined by manager)

### Common Promotion Scenarios

**Scenario 1: High Performer, Short Tenure**
* Employee received Rating 5 but has only been in role for 8 months
* **Typical Outcome:** Deferred to next cycle with documented plan to achieve 12-month tenure. May receive spot bonus or equity grant as interim recognition.

**Scenario 2: Consistently Strong, Long Tenure**
* Employee has been in role for 3+ years with consistent "Meets" ratings and one "Exceeds"
* **Typical Outcome:** Eligible for consideration if scope has genuinely expanded. Manager must demonstrate next-level work, not just longevity.

**Scenario 3: New Scope, Same Level**
* Employee took on significantly more responsibility mid-year
* **Typical Outcome:** May receive compensation adjustment without level change, or promoted if new scope aligns with next level.

### Failed Promotion: What Happens Next?

If your promotion is not approved, your manager will:
1. Explain the specific gaps between your current performance and next-level expectations
2. Create a **Promotion Readiness Plan** outlining:
   * Skills or scope to develop
   * Timeline for reassessment (typically 6-12 months)
   * Interim milestones to demonstrate progress
3. Schedule quarterly check-ins on promotion readiness
4. Consider spot bonuses or equity grants if budget allows

**You may ask:**
* What specific evidence or outcomes would make me promotion-ready?
* Are there project opportunities that would help me demonstrate next-level work?
* What is the realistic timeline for my next promotion opportunity?

## Performance Improvement Plans (PIP)

A Performance Improvement Plan is a formal, documented process to address significant performance deficiencies and provide a clear path to success.

### When is a PIP Initiated?

**Mandatory PIP Triggers:**
* Employee receives a Rating 1 (Does Not Meet Expectations)
* Employee receives consecutive Rating 2 (Developing) ratings
* Serious performance issue (e.g., repeated missed deadlines, customer escalations, policy violations)

**Discretionary PIP:**
* Manager observes sustained underperformance mid-cycle and wants to formalize expectations
* Employee requests a PIP to gain clarity on expectations

### PIP Philosophy

**Our Belief:** A PIP is a tool for success, not a termination process. We genuinely want employees to improve and succeed. However, a PIP is a serious intervention, and employees must demonstrate significant improvement to continue employment.

**Success Rate:** Approximately 40% of employees on PIPs successfully complete them and continue in their roles.

### PIP Structure and Timeline

**Standard Duration:** 30, 60, or 90 days (60 days is most common)

**PIP Components:**

1. **Performance Deficiencies**
   * Specific, objective description of gaps
   * Examples with dates and impact
   * Reference to previous feedback or warnings

2. **Improvement Goals**
   * 3-5 SMART goals that address the deficiencies
   * Clear, measurable success criteria
   * Must be achievable within the PIP timeline

3. **Support and Resources**
   * Training, tools, or coaching to be provided
   * Increased check-in frequency with manager
   * Adjusted workload if appropriate

4. **Check-in Schedule**
   * Weekly 1:1s (minimum 30 minutes)
   * Bi-weekly written progress updates
   * Mid-point formal review

5. **Consequences**
   * Clear statement: "Failure to meet these goals may result in further action, up to and including termination of employment"

### PIP Development Process

**Step 1: Manager Drafts PIP (2-3 days)**
* Manager documents performance issues with specific examples
* Drafts measurable improvement goals
* Identifies support and resources

**Step 2: HR Review (1-2 days)**
* HR Business Partner reviews for:
  - Legal compliance and fairness
  - Clarity of expectations
  - Reasonableness of timeline
  - Consistency with similar cases
* HR may request revisions or additional documentation

**Step 3: Legal Review (if complex) (1 day)**
* Employment counsel reviews if:
  - Employee has raised discrimination/harassment concerns
  - Employee is in protected class and situation could be perceived as discriminatory
  - Performance issues overlap with medical leave or accommodation

**Step 4: Delivery Meeting (1 day after approval)**
* **Participants:** Manager, Employee, HR Business Partner (required)
* **Duration:** 30-60 minutes
* **Manager Actions:**
  - Present PIP document and walk through each section
  - Allow employee to ask questions
  - Avoid debate; PIP is not negotiable at this stage
  - Express genuine support and belief in employee's ability to improve
* **Employee Actions:**
  - Employee receives copy of PIP
  - Employee signs acknowledgment (signature does not indicate agreement, only receipt)
  - Employee may provide written response within 3 business days

**Step 5: PIP Execution (30-90 days)**
* Weekly check-ins documented in writing
* Manager tracks progress against each goal
* Mid-point review (Day 30 for 60-day PIPs) with HR present
* Manager may extend PIP by up to 50% of original timeline if progress is demonstrated but goals not fully met

**Step 6: Final Evaluation**
* Manager assesses performance against each goal
* HR reviews documentation
* Three possible outcomes:
  1. **Successful Completion:** Employee met or exceeded all goals; PIP is closed; employee returns to normal performance management
  2. **Extension:** Substantial progress shown but more time needed; PIP extended (one-time only)
  3. **Unsuccessful:** Goals not met; employment terminated (severance may be offered per company policy)

### Employee Rights During a PIP

You have the right to:
* Request clarification on any goal or expectation
* Provide your perspective in writing
* Request specific resources or tools you believe are necessary
* Appeal the PIP if you believe it is discriminatory or retaliatory (file appeal with Chief HR Officer within 5 business days of delivery)

**What You Cannot Do:**
* Refuse to participate (grounds for immediate termination)
* Negotiate the timeline or goals (unless manager agrees)
* Transfer to a different team during an active PIP

### Manager Best Practices for PIPs

1. **Document thoroughly:** Every conversation, deliverable, and outcome should be documented
2. **Be consistent:** Apply the same standards you would to any other employee
3. **Be supportive:** Check in regularly and provide actionable feedback
4. **Be honest:** If improvement is not happening, say so clearly and promptly
5. **Involve HR early:** Never deliver a PIP without HR review and presence

### Life After a PIP

**If Successful:**
* PIP is closed and not mentioned in future reviews (unless pattern repeats)
* Employee is eligible for normal merit increases in next cycle
* Promotion eligibility: Must demonstrate sustained strong performance for at least 12 months post-PIP

**If Unsuccessful:**
* Employment is typically terminated on the final day of the PIP
* Severance: Eligible for standard severance package (if applicable per company policy)
* References: Company provides dates of employment and title only (neutral reference)

## Compensation Adjustments

Performance ratings directly influence annual compensation decisions. This section explains how merit increases, bonuses, and equity are determined.

### Merit Increase Guidelines

Merit increases are applied to base salary and are effective **March 1** each year (following February performance reviews).

**Standard Merit Increase Ranges by Rating:**

| Rating | Typical Merit Increase | Conditions |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| **5 (Distinguished)** | 8-12% | May include equity refresh grant |
| **4 (Exceeds)** | 5-7% | Bonus eligible |
| **3 (Meets)** | 2-4% | Standard merit pool |
| **2 (Developing)** | 0-2% | Market adjustments only |
| **1 (Does Not Meet)** | 0% | PIP initiated; no increase |

**Factors Influencing Your Specific Increase:**
* **Compa-ratio:** Your current salary relative to the midpoint of your role's market range
  - Below 80% of market: Larger adjustment to bring closer to market
  - 100-110% of market: Smaller increase (already at/above market)
* **Budget:** Company-wide merit budget set by Finance and Board
* **Internal Equity:** Adjustment to address pay disparities within team
* **Promotion:** Promotional increases typically 8-15% depending on scope change

### Market Adjustments

**Annual Market Review:** HR conducts a comprehensive market analysis each November using:
* Radford Global Compensation Database
* OptionImpact (for equity benchmarking)
* Local market surveys for specific geographies

**Adjustment Triggers:**
* Employee's salary falls below **80% of market midpoint** for role and geography
* Significant market movement in specific job families (e.g., Engineering, Data Science)
* New hire offers create internal equity concerns

**Process:**
* Market adjustments are applied independently of performance ratings
* Communicated separately from annual review (typically December)
* Effective January 1

### Bonus Eligibility

**Performance Bonus Program:**
* Available to employees rated 4 or 5
* Bonus pool funded based on company performance against annual financial targets
* Individual bonus amount:
  - **Rating 5:** 15-20% of base salary
  - **Rating 4:** 8-12% of base salary

**Payout Timeline:** Bonuses paid in March, along with merit increase adjustments

**Commission Plans (Sales Roles):**
* Commission-based roles follow separate compensation plans
* Performance rating influences on-target earnings (OTE) adjustments but not commission structure

### Equity Compensation

**Initial Equity Grants:**
* Provided at hire based on role level and market data
* Typically vests over 4 years (25% annual vesting or monthly vesting, depending on role level)

**Refresh Grants:**
* Awarded to top performers (Rating 5) to maintain retention and motivation
* Considered annually based on:
  - Performance rating
  - Current unvested equity remaining
  - Role criticality
  - Retention risk
* Refresh grants typically 20-50% of original grant size

**Promotion Equity:**
* Employees promoted to Director level or higher receive equity adjustment to match new level's target grant

## Career Development and Growth

Performance reviews are not just about evaluation—they're a tool for career development and growth planning.

### Individual Development Plans (IDP)

Every employee should have an **IDP** that outlines:
1. **Career Aspirations:** Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?
2. **Skill Gaps:** What competencies or experiences do you need to develop?
3. **Development Actions:** Specific activities (training, stretch projects, mentorship)
4. **Timeline:** When will you complete these actions?

**IDP Review Cadence:**
* Created or updated during annual performance review
* Reviewed quarterly during 1:1s
* Adjusted as goals or interests change

### Learning and Development Resources

**Company-Provided Resources:**
* **LinkedIn Learning:** Unlimited access to 15,000+ courses
* **Conference Budget:** Up to $1,500/year for role-related conferences
* **Certification Reimbursement:** Up to $3,000/year for approved certifications (PMP, AWS, CPA, etc.)
* **Tuition Assistance:** Up to $5,000/year for degree programs related to your career path (requires manager + VP approval)
* **Internal Mentorship Program:** Quarterly matching with senior leaders

**Self-Directed Growth:**
* Shadow other departments or roles
* Join cross-functional task forces or working groups
* Present at internal lunch-and-learns or team meetings
* Contribute to open-source projects (with IP policy compliance)

### Career Pathing Resources

**Career Ladders:**
* Detailed career ladders for all job families available on the HR Portal
* Each level defines:
  - Scope of responsibility
  - Technical/functional skills required
  - Leadership and collaboration expectations
  - Typical years of experience

**Career Conversations:**
* Separate from performance reviews
* Schedule at least twice per year
* Focus on long-term aspirations, not current role performance

---

## Special Circumstances

### Leaves of Absence

**Medical Leave, Parental Leave, or Extended Absence:**
* If an employee is on approved leave during the review cycle:
  - **Less than 50% of cycle:** Employee receives a full review based on time worked
  - **More than 50% of cycle:** Review is deferred to next cycle; rating marked as "Not Rated - Leave of Absence"
* Compensation adjustments:
  - Employees on leave receive market adjustments but may not receive merit increases if not rated
  - Upon return, employee may be eligible for off-cycle adjustment at manager's discretion

### Transfers and Role Changes

**Internal Transfer During Review Cycle:**
* If transfer occurred before July 1: New manager conducts review
* If transfer occurred after July 1: Shared review (both managers provide input; new manager delivers)
* All goals and feedback from prior role are included

**Interim or Acting Roles:**
* If you served in an interim role (e.g., Acting Manager) for 6+ months, your review should reflect responsibilities of the interim role, not just your base role

### Acquisitions and New Entities

Employees who join through acquisition:
* First review cycle after acquisition: Rated but not eligible for promotion (integration period)
* Compensation adjustments aligned to company standards during integration

### Remote/International Employees

* All policies apply equally regardless of location
* Calibration sessions include remote employees
* Compensation benchmarked to local market or role-based geography (per offer letter)
* Performance review meetings conducted via video conference

### Issue 3: Disagreement with Manager's Rating

**Symptoms:** You believe your rating is unfair or not aligned with your performance

**Solutions:**
1. **Request a follow-up meeting:** Ask your manager to walk through the specific evidence and rationale
2. **Review calibration context:** Ask whether your rating changed during calibration and why
3. **Provide additional evidence:** If you have accomplishments your manager was unaware of, document them
4. **Formal appeal process:**
   - Submit written appeal to HR within 5 business days of review delivery
   - Include: specific rating you believe is appropriate and supporting evidence
   - HR will review with your skip-level manager
   - Appeal decision is final (typically within 10 business days)

**Important:** Appeals are taken seriously but rarely result in rating changes unless clear evidence of error or bias exists.

### Issue 4: Rating Changed During Calibration

**Symptoms:** Your manager told you to expect a certain rating, but you received a different one

**Explanation:**
Calibration is designed to ensure consistency across the organization. Your manager may have initially proposed a rating that was adjusted based on comparative performance with peers.

**What to do:**
* Ask your manager to explain the calibration discussion (they should be transparent)
* Understand the comparative context: Who were you calibrated against? What was the rationale?
* Focus on the feedback and development, not just the rating number

---

### Issue 5: Manager Left During Review Cycle

**Symptoms:** Your manager departed the company before completing your review

**Solutions:**
* Your new manager (or interim manager) will conduct your review
* They will gather input from:
  - Your former manager (if they're willing to provide feedback as a departing employee)
  - Peer reviews
  - Project documentation and metrics
  - Your self-review
* You may request a meeting with your skip-level manager if you feel the new manager lacks context

---

### Issue 6: Goals Became Irrelevant Mid-Year

**Symptoms:** Business priorities shifted, making your original goals obsolete

**Solutions:**
* Raise this during Mid-Year Check-in (or immediately if it happens outside this window)
* Manager can adjust or replace goals with HR approval
* Document the business rationale for the change
* Original goals should remain visible in Lattice with a note: "Deprioritized due to [business change]; replaced with [new goal]"

## Manager Best Practices

This section provides guidance for people managers conducting performance reviews.

### Preparing for Performance Reviews

**Two Weeks Before Delivery:**
1. Review all inputs (self-review, peer feedback, goal completion data)
2. Draft performance narrative (2-3 pages recommended)
3. Prepare specific examples for each rating dimension
4. Anticipate employee questions or concerns
5. Confirm compensation changes with HR and Finance
6. Schedule 90-120 minute meeting in private setting

**One Week Before Delivery:**
1. Review with your skip-level manager or HR Partner
2. Rehearse delivery if this is your first time or a difficult conversation
3. Prepare development plan and next-year goals

### Delivering the Review

**Meeting Structure:**
1. **Opening (5 min):** Set tone; explain structure; give employee space to feel emotions
2. **Performance Summary (20 min):** Walk through accomplishments and challenges
3. **Rating Reveal (10 min):** State the rating clearly; explain rationale; pause for reaction
4. **Compensation (10 min):** Explain merit increase, bonus, or equity changes
5. **Development Discussion (30 min):** Discuss growth areas and career aspirations
6. **Goal Setting (20 min):** Preview next year's priorities and draft initial goals
7. **Closing (5 min):** Invite questions; reinforce support; schedule follow-up

**Delivery Tips:**
* **Be direct and clear:** Don't bury the rating or sugarcoat bad news
* **Use specific examples:** Avoid generalities like "you did great work"
* **Listen actively:** Give employee space to react and respond
* **Acknowledge emotions:** It's normal for employees to feel disappointed, surprised, or upset
* **Focus on growth:** Even top performers have areas to develop

### Handling Difficult Conversations

**Scenario: Employee is upset by their rating**
* Validate their feelings: "I understand this is disappointing"
* Reiterate objective evidence: "Let's review the goals and outcomes together"
* Avoid becoming defensive: Stay calm and factual
* Offer to revisit in a follow-up meeting if emotions are high
* Document the conversation afterward

**Scenario: Employee threatens to quit**
* Take the concern seriously; inform HR immediately
* Understand whether this is about the rating, compensation, or other factors
* If the employee is a high performer and retention is critical, HR may explore options (spot bonus, equity, role adjustment)
* Do not make promises you cannot keep

**Scenario: Employee claims bias or discrimination**
* Take the allegation seriously; do not dismiss it
* Inform HR and Legal immediately
* Pause the performance review process pending investigation
* Do not retaliate or treat the employee differently

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: When will I receive my performance review?**
A: Reviews are delivered during the window of February 15-22. Your manager will schedule a meeting with you. If you don't have a meeting scheduled by February 14, reach out to your manager.

**Q: How long does the review meeting last?**
A: Plan for 90-120 minutes. This is one of the most important career conversations of the year; it should not be rushed.

**Q: Can I bring someone with me to the review meeting?**
A: Performance reviews are typically one-on-one with your manager. If you have concerns about the meeting, you may request that an HR representative be present. You cannot bring a personal representative (e.g., lawyer, family member).

**Q: Will my review be shared with anyone besides my manager?**
A: Your review is visible to your manager, your skip-level manager, your HR Business Partner, and executive leadership (Director level and above). It is confidential and not shared with peers.

---

### Questions About Ratings

**Q: What percentage of employees receive each rating?**
A: See the target distribution in the Calibration section above. Approximately 55-60% of employees receive a "Meets Expectations" rating, which is a positive and successful rating.

**Q: Can I receive a high rating but no promotion?**
A: Yes. Promotion depends on multiple factors beyond performance rating, including tenure, open headcount, and business need. A high rating makes you eligible but does not guarantee promotion.

**Q: If I got a 3 (Meets) this year, can I get a 4 (Exceeds) next year?**
A: Absolutely. Ratings are not cumulative or career-limiting. Many employees move between ratings year to year based on performance and circumstances.

**Q: What happens if my manager and I disagree on my rating?**
A: You can request a follow-up discussion to understand the rationale. If you believe the rating is unfair, you can file a formal appeal (see Troubleshooting section).

---

### Questions About Compensation

**Q: Can I negotiate my merit increase?**
A: Merit increases are based on performance ratings and market data, and are typically not negotiable. However, if you believe there's a compensation equity issue (e.g., you're significantly underpaid compared to peers), you can raise this with your manager or HR.

**Q: When will I see my merit increase in my paycheck?**
A: Merit increases and promotions are effective March 1 and will appear in your mid-March paycheck.

**Q: Do I get a bonus if I'm rated "Meets Expectations"?**
A: The performance bonus program is typically available only to employees rated 4 (Exceeds) or 5 (Distinguished). However, company-wide bonuses may be distributed separately based on overall company performance.

**Q: What if I think I should have received a larger increase?**
A: Schedule a compensation conversation with your manager. Ask about your compa-ratio (where you sit relative to market) and what it would take to receive a larger increase next year.

---

### Questions About Promotions

**Q: Can I request an off-cycle promotion?**
A: Off-cycle promotions are rare and require CEO approval. They are usually reserved for critical retention situations or significant unexpected role changes (e.g., taking over a departing manager's team mid-year).

**Q: I've been in my role for 3 years and haven't been promoted. Why?**
A: Tenure alone does not qualify someone for promotion. The key question is whether you are already demonstrating the skills and scope of the next level. Schedule a career conversation with your manager to create a promotion readiness plan.

**Q: If my promotion is denied, when can I be reconsidered?**
A: Typically 6-12 months, depending on the gaps identified. Your manager should create a clear plan outlining what you need to demonstrate.

---

### Questions About Peer Reviews

**Q: Who sees my peer reviews?**
A: Your manager sees the names and content of all peer reviews. You (the employee) see the content but it is anonymized to encourage honest feedback.

**Q: Can I see who my peers nominated?**
A: No. Peer nominations and reviewer identities are confidential to protect the integrity of the feedback.

**Q: What if I receive a peer review that I think is inaccurate or unfair?**
A: Peer reviews are one input among many. If you believe feedback is inaccurate, discuss it with your manager during your review meeting. Provide your perspective and evidence.

**Q: Do I have to complete peer reviews I'm assigned?**
A: Yes. Completing peer review requests is a professional expectation. Failure to complete assigned peer reviews may be noted in your own performance evaluation.

---

### Questions About Development

**Q: What if I don't know what I want my career path to be?**
A: That's okay. Career aspirations evolve. Use your 1:1s to explore different areas of interest, shadow other teams, and talk to people in roles you find interesting. Your manager and HR can help you explore options.

**Q: Can I change teams or roles?**
A: Yes. Internal mobility is encouraged. You should discuss your interest with your current manager first (transparency is expected). If you've been in your current role less than 18 months, transfers require VP approval.

**Q: What training resources are available?**
A: See the Career Development and Growth section above for a full list of learning resources.
