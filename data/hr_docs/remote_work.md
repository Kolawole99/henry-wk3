## FAQ
**Q: Can I move to a different state?**
A: You must notify HR **30 days before moving**. Pay may be adjusted based on the Cost of Labor in the new location (tier-based geography). Moving without notifying HR is grounds for termination due to tax nexus laws.

**Q: Can I work internationally?**
A: No. Due to tax and visa complexities, you cannot work from outside the country for more than 2 weeks (during WFA time) without specific legal approval.

**Q: What if I am sick on an office day?**
A: Do not come in. Use a Sick Day or, if you feel well enough to work, request to work remote for the day via Slack to your manager.
