## Purpose and Philosophy

### Our Work Philosophy
We believe that flexibility and trust enable our teams to do their best work. This policy is designed to:
* **Maximize Productivity:** Empower employees to work where they're most effective
* **Support Work-Life Balance:** Reduce commute time and provide schedule flexibility
* **Attract Top Talent:** Compete for talent regardless of geographic location
* **Maintain Collaboration:** Preserve in-person connection and culture
* **Ensure Security:** Protect company data and systems across all work locations

### Guiding Principles
1. **Flexibility with Accountability:** You choose where you work; you're accountable for outcomes
2. **Equity:** All employees, regardless of work location, have equal access to opportunities, development, and advancement
3. **Manager Discretion:** Managers may require in-office presence for specific business needs (team meetings, client visits, onboarding)
4. **Default to Transparency:** Communicate your location and availability clearly
5. **Security First:** Company data protection is non-negotiable

## Work Classification System

Every role at the company is assigned one of three work classifications based on job function, collaboration needs, and business requirements. Your classification is specified in your offer letter and can be reviewed or changed during annual planning cycles.

### How Classifications Are Determined

**Factors Considered:**
* **Role Requirements:** Does the role require physical presence (e.g., lab work, facility management)?
* **Collaboration Intensity:** How often does the role require synchronous, real-time collaboration?
* **Client/Partner Interaction:** Does the role involve in-person client meetings or on-site partner work?
* **Team Dynamics:** What is the team's composition and geographic distribution?
* **Business Continuity:** Are there coverage needs that require on-site staffing?

**Classification Review:**
* Work classifications are reviewed annually during Q4 planning
* Employees may request classification changes via their manager (subject to VP approval)
* Business needs may require classification adjustments with 90 days' notice

---

## Hybrid Work Model (Standard)

The Hybrid model is the default classification for most roles. It balances the benefits of in-person collaboration with the flexibility of remote work.

### Core Requirements

**In-Office Commitment:** 3 days per week in office, 2 days remote

**Anchor Days (Mandatory In-Office Days):**
* **Tuesday:** Company-wide anchor day (all meetings requiring in-person attendance scheduled on Tuesdays)
* **Thursday:** Department anchor day (team meetings, collaboration sessions, 1:1s)
* **Third Day:** Determined by your manager based on team needs (commonly Monday or Wednesday)

**Flexible Days:**
* Monday, Wednesday, or Friday (as determined by your manager)
* Can be used for remote work, focus time, or personal flexibility

### Workspace and Desk Assignment

**Dedicated Desk:**
* All Hybrid employees are assigned a dedicated desk at the HQ office
* Desk assignments are managed by Facilities via the SpaceIQ system
* Your name and department will be displayed at your assigned workstation

**Desk Personalization:**
* You may personalize your workspace with photos, plants, and small decorations
* Items must fit within your desk footprint and not obstruct neighbors
* Valuables should not be left overnight (company is not liable for theft)

**Desk Sharing:**
* Desks are not shared; you maintain exclusive use of your assigned space
* If you anticipate being remote for 3+ consecutive weeks, notify Facilities to temporarily release your desk

### Parking and Commute

**Parking:**
* Hybrid employees receive a parking pass for the company garage
* Park in designated "Hybrid/Full-Time" spots (Levels 2-5)
* Lost parking passes incur a $25 replacement fee

**Commute Benefits:**
* **Pre-Tax Transit:** Enroll in the commuter benefits program for pre-tax transit pass purchases (up to $300/month)
* **Bike Storage:** Secure bike racks available in parking garage Level 1
* **Carpool Program:** Join the internal carpool matching system via the HR Portal

### Scheduling and Flexibility

**Weekly Schedule:**
Your in-office days should be consistent week-to-week to enable team planning. To change your regular schedule:
1. Discuss with your manager (at least 2 weeks' notice preferred)
2. Update your schedule in Workday under "Work Location"
3. Notify your team via Slack or email

**Occasional Swaps:**
If you need to swap an in-office day for a remote day (e.g., home repair appointment):
1. Request approval via Slack from your manager
2. Log the swap in Workday as "Ad Hoc Remote - [Reason]"
3. Must maintain 3 in-office days that week unless using PTO

**Extended Remote Periods:**
If you need to work remotely for 2+ consecutive weeks (e.g., family care, home renovation):
1. Submit formal request to your manager and HR at least 3 weeks in advance
2. Provide justification and end date
3. Requires VP approval for periods exceeding 4 weeks

### In-Office Etiquette and Culture

**Meeting Room Etiquette:**
* Book meeting rooms via Outlook/Room Finder (rooms auto-release if unused after 10 minutes)
* Clean up after use; wipe whiteboards
* Hybrid meetings should accommodate remote participants (use Zoom even if some attendees are in-person)

**Noise and Focus:**
* Use headphones for music and video calls
* Take phone calls in phone booths or huddle rooms (not at your desk)
* Respect "Focus Time" blocks on colleagues' calendars

**Kitchen and Common Areas:**
* Clean up after yourself; load dishwasher
* Label food in refrigerators with name and date
* Expired food removed every Friday at 5 PM

---

## Remote Work Model (Fully Distributed)

The Remote classification is for employees who live outside of a commutable distance from any company office or whose roles are designed to be fully distributed.

### Eligibility Criteria

You qualify as Remote if:
* You live **more than 50 miles** from a company office (HQ or regional hub)
* Your role was posted as "Remote" at time of hire
* You transferred to a fully remote role with manager and HR approval

**Not Eligible:**
* Roles requiring hands-on work (Lab Technicians, Facilities, IT Support)
* First 90 days of employment (onboarding period requires in-office presence for Hybrid roles; Remote hires exempt)

### Office Visit Expectations

**Quarterly Team Week:**
* Remote employees are expected to visit HQ **once per quarter** for "Team Week"
* Team Weeks are scheduled by departments (typically first full week of each quarter)
* **Company-Paid Travel:** Airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and meals are fully covered

**Team Week Activities:**
* All-hands meetings and department strategy sessions
* Team-building activities and social events
* In-person 1:1s with manager and skip-level
* Cross-functional collaboration workshops

**Booking Travel for Team Week:**
1. Receive Team Week invite from your manager (6-8 weeks in advance)
2. Book travel via Company Travel Portal (see Travel Policy for guidelines)
3. Expense hotel, meals, and ground transport per standard policy
4. If you cannot attend due to personal conflict, notify manager immediately

**Additional Office Visits:**
* You may visit the office outside of Team Week for any reason

2. Select date(s) you'll be in office
3. Choose available desk from the "Remote Worker" zone (2nd Floor, Northwest corner)
4. Booking confirmation sent via email

**Hot Desk Amenities:**
* Monitor, keyboard, mouse, and docking station at each desk

* No overnight storage; clear your space at end of day

**Cancellation:**
* Cancel booking at least 24 hours in advance to free up space
* No-shows (2 or more in 6 months) may result in booking restrictions

### Remote Work Best Practices

**Creating a Productive Workspace:**
* Dedicate a specific area of your home for work (not bed or couch)
* Ensure good lighting and ergonomic setup
* Minimize distractions (separate space from high-traffic areas if possible)

**Staying Connected:**
* Over-communicate: Share updates, blockers, and progress more frequently than you think necessary
* Turn on video during meetings to build rapport
* Participate in virtual social events (trivia, coffee chats, etc.)
* Proactively reach out to colleagues for informal chats

**Combating Isolation:**
* Join virtual co-working sessions (scheduled daily via Slack #remote-watercooler)
* Attend local meetups or co-working spaces 1-2x/month (up to $100/month expensable)
* Utilize the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for mental health support

## Work From Anywhere (WFA) Program

The WFA program allows employees to work from a location outside their primary work location for extended periods while maintaining normal job responsibilities.

### Program Overview

**Annual Allowance:** All Hybrid and Remote employees are eligible for **4 weeks per calendar year** of "Work From Anywhere."

**What Qualifies as WFA:**
* Working from a different city, state, or country (with restrictions; see International Work section)
* Working while traveling for personal reasons (vacation hybrid)
* Working from a family member's home in a different location

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
* Working from your designated home location (Remote employees)
* Working from your normal office (Hybrid employees on an in-office day)
* Business travel or attending conferences (separate category)

### Eligibility and Requirements

**Eligibility:**
* Must have been employed for at least **90 days**
* Must be in good performance standing (not on a PIP)
* Role must allow for fully remote execution of responsibilities

**Requirements:**
1. **Time Zone Overlap:** Must maintain at least **4 hours of overlap** with your primary team's core hours (10 AM - 3 PM in team's time zone)
2. **Connectivity:** Reliable high-speed internet (minimum 25 Mbps download, 5 Mbps upload)
3. **Availability:** Attend all scheduled meetings via video
4. **Security:** VPN required for accessing company systems
5. **Logging:** Must log WFA in Workday and get manager approval

### How to Request WFA

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Plan Ahead:** Submit request at least **2 weeks in advance** for domestic WFA, **4 weeks** for international
2. **Check Team Calendar:** Ensure no critical in-person meetings or team events during your WFA period
3. **Submit in Workday:**
   - Navigate to "Time Off" → "Request Work From Anywhere"
   - Select dates, location, and time zone
   - Provide brief business justification
4. **Manager Approval:** Manager reviews and approves/denies within 3 business days
5. **Confirmation:** You'll receive email confirmation; update your Slack status and calendar

**Manager Approval Criteria:**
Managers should approve unless:
* Critical in-person work is required during the dates
* Team coverage would be inadequate
* Employee is new to role and needs closer collaboration
* Previous WFA periods showed performance or communication issues

### During Your WFA Period

**Communication:**
* Update Slack status to indicate location and time zone (e.g., "WFA from Austin, TX - CST")
* Update calendar working hours to reflect new time zone
* Over-communicate availability and progress

**Meetings:**
* Attend all scheduled meetings (adjust your personal schedule to accommodate time zone differences)
* Decline meetings only if timing is genuinely impossible (e.g., 2 AM in your WFA location)

**Workspace:**
* Ensure private, professional workspace for video calls
* Test audio/video quality before your first meeting

**Expenses:**
* Personal travel costs (flights, lodging) are not reimbursable
* Co-working space fees are reimbursable up to $100/week (submit receipt)
* Internet costs are not reimbursable (even if different from home)

### Tracking Your WFA Balance

**How to Check:**
* Log into Workday → My Time → WFA Balance
* Balance displays: "X weeks remaining out of 4 annual weeks"

**Accrual:**
* WFA weeks do not roll over to the next calendar year
* Partial weeks are tracked in days (1 week = 5 business days)
* If you WFA for 3 days, it counts as 0.6 weeks

**Conflicts with PTO:**
If you take PTO during a WFA period:
* PTO days do not count toward your WFA balance
* Example: You WFA for 2 weeks but take 3 PTO days during that period = only 1.4 WFA weeks used

## Geographic Relocation and International Work

### Domestic Relocation (Within the U.S.)

**Notification Requirement:**
You must notify HR **30 days before moving** to a new state or city.

**Why Notification Is Required:**
* **Tax Compliance:** Company must withhold taxes based on your work location
* **Legal Nexus:** Company may need to register in new state for tax purposes
* **Compensation Adjustment:** Pay may be adjusted based on Cost of Labor in new location

**Relocation Process:**

1. **Notify Your Manager:** Discuss your plans and ensure role can be performed from new location
2. **Submit Relocation Form:** HR Portal → "Request Relocation"
3. **HR Review:** HR assesses:
   - Tax and legal implications
   - Compensation adjustments (see Geography-Based Tiers below)
   - Workspace availability if moving closer to an office
4. **Approval/Denial:** HR responds within 10 business days
5. **Update Workday:** Once approved, update address in Workday

**Geography-Based Compensation Tiers:**

We use a tiered system to adjust compensation based on Cost of Labor:

| Tier | Example Locations | Compensation Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Tier 1 (High Cost)** | San Francisco, NYC, Seattle, Boston | 100% (baseline) |
| **Tier 2 (Moderate Cost)** | Austin, Denver, Chicago, Portland | 90% |
| **Tier 3 (Standard Cost)** | Phoenix, Atlanta, Raleigh, Salt Lake City | 80% |
| **Tier 4 (Low Cost)** | Boise, Des Moines, Topeka, rural areas | 70% |

**Compensation Adjustment Timing:**
* If moving to higher tier: Adjustment effective first day of month after move
* If moving to lower tier: Adjustment effective 90 days after move (grace period)

**Exceptions:**
* Adjustments do not apply if you were hired explicitly as Remote in your current location
* Relocations within same tier: No adjustment

### International Relocation and Work

**General Policy:** Employees cannot work from outside the United States for extended periods without explicit company approval.

**Why International Work Is Restricted:**
* **Tax Complexity:** Creates "permanent establishment" tax liabilities
* **Employment Law:** Foreign labor laws may apply
* **Visa/Work Permit:** Company may be required to sponsor work permits
* **Data Privacy:** GDPR and other regulations may apply

**Short-Term International Work (Up to 2 Weeks):**
You may use WFA time to work from another country for up to **2 consecutive weeks per year** under these conditions:
* **Approved Countries:** Canada, UK, Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Australia, Japan
* **Advance Notice:** Submit WFA request at least **4 weeks in advance** (requires HR + Legal approval)
* **Tax Disclaimer:** You acknowledge you're responsible for any personal tax implications
* **Travel Insurance:** Ensure your health insurance covers international travel

**Permanent International Relocation:**
* Generally not supported unless company has a legal entity in the target country
* Current entities: **United States (HQ)**, **Canada (Toronto)**, **United Kingdom (London)**
* Contact HR to explore options; requires VP + Legal approval

### Moving Without Notification

**Consequences:**
* Immediate termination of employment (per policy)
* Company may face tax penalties and fines due to your non-disclosure
* You may be held financially responsible for tax penalties incurred

**Rationale:**
This is not punitive; it's legally required. The company must comply with state and federal tax laws, which require accurate reporting of employee work locations.

## Manager Responsibilities

Managers play a critical role in enabling effective remote and hybrid work for their teams.

### Setting Expectations

**Managers should:**
* Clarify team-specific in-office days (beyond company anchor days)
* Define availability expectations for your team (if stricter than core hours)
* Communicate meeting norms (video on/off, recording, etc.)
* Set performance goals focused on outcomes, not hours logged

### Monitoring Performance

**Focus on Outcomes, Not Activity:**
* Evaluate employees based on deliverables, quality, and impact
* Avoid "surveillance" tools or excessive check-ins
* Trust employees to manage their time

**Regular Check-Ins:**
* Weekly 1:1s (minimum 30 minutes) for all direct reports
* Bi-weekly team syncs (in-person or hybrid)
* Quarterly skip-level meetings for remote employees

### Supporting Remote Employees

**Managers should proactively:**
* Include remote employees in all team communications (don't rely on "office hallway" conversations)
* Ensure remote employees have equal access to high-visibility projects
* Address any perception that remote employees are less committed or productive
* Create opportunities for remote employees to connect with team (virtual social events, in-person Team Weeks)

### Addressing Performance Issues

If a remote or hybrid employee is underperforming:
* Diagnose the root cause: Is it skill gap, motivation, work environment, or personal circumstances?
* Provide clear, documented feedback
* Offer support (training, equipment upgrades, schedule adjustments)
* If underperformance persists, follow standard PIP process (see Performance Review Policy)

**Manager Red Flags:**
* Consistently missing meetings or deadlines
* Poor communication or unresponsiveness during core hours
* Decline in work quality
* Team members expressing frustration with collaboration

---

## Performance Expectations

Your work location does not change performance standards. All employees are held to the same expectations regardless of classification.

### Outcomes Over Hours

**What Matters:**
* Achievement of goals and OKRs
* Quality of work and deliverables
* Collaboration and communication with team
* Contribution to company culture and values

**What Does NOT Matter:**
* Whether you work 8 AM - 4 PM vs. 10 AM - 6 PM
* Whether you work from home, office, or coffee shop
* How many hours you're online (as long as you meet core hours and deliver results)

### Communication Standards

**All Employees Must:**
* Respond to messages within expected timeframes (see Core Hours section)
* Keep calendar up-to-date and accurate
* Communicate proactively (share progress, blockers, availability changes)
* Attend scheduled meetings or decline with notice

### Collaboration and Culture

**Remote and Hybrid Employees Should:**
* Turn on video during team meetings (barring technical or personal issues)
* Participate in virtual or in-person social events when feasible
* Mentor and support colleagues regardless of location
* Contribute to team documentation and knowledge sharing

### Performance Reviews

* Work classification is NOT a factor in performance ratings
* Remote employees are equally eligible for promotions, raises, and bonuses
* Managers should proactively address any bias favoring in-office employees

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Issue 1: Manager Denying WFA Request

**Symptoms:** You submitted a WFA request and it was denied or delayed.

**Possible Reasons:**
* Critical in-person work scheduled during your dates (client visit, team offsite, product launch)
* Manager concerned about team coverage
* Previous WFA periods showed performance or communication issues

**Solutions:**
1. Request a conversation with your manager to understand the specific reason
2. Propose alternative dates
3. If you believe denial is unfair, escalate to HR for review

---

### Issue 2: Internet Outage at Home

**Symptoms:** Your home internet goes down and you cannot work.

**Solutions:**
1. **Short Outage (< 2 hours):**
   - Use mobile hotspot as backup
   - Notify manager via Slack (from phone)
   - Reschedule any urgent meetings
2. **Extended Outage (> 2 hours):**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Can I work from a coffee shop or library?**
A: Yes, as long as you follow security protocols (VPN for sensitive work, privacy screen, no confidential conversations in public).

**Q: Can I work from my car?**
A: Not recommended due to ergonomics, internet reliability, and safety concerns. Use a co-working space or library if you need a workspace outside home/office.

**Q: What if I want to change my work classification?**
A: Discuss with your manager. Classification changes require manager + VP approval and must align with business needs. Submit request via HR Portal.

---

### Hybrid Questions

**Q: Can I skip an office day if no one else on my team is coming in?**
A: No. In-office days are not optional, even if your immediate team is remote. The purpose is cross-team collaboration and culture-building, not just your direct team.

**Q: What happens if I'm consistently remote on in-office days without approval?**
A: This is a policy violation and will result in performance management action. First offense: verbal warning. Repeated offenses: written warning or termination.

**Q: Can I come to the office on my remote days?**
A: Yes, you're always welcome in the office. Your desk is dedicated to you and available daily.

---

### Remote Questions

**Q: Do I have to attend Team Week if I can't afford the time off (e.g., childcare, pet care)?**
A: Team Week is a core expectation of Remote roles. If you have genuine hardship, discuss with your manager in advance. Exceptions are rare but may be considered on case-by-case basis.

**Q: Can I expense co-working space daily?**
A: You can expense up to $100/month, which typically covers 2-5 day passes depending on location. Unlimited daily reimbursement is not provided.

**Q: What if I live near the office but was hired as Remote?**
A: Your classification remains Remote unless you request a change. You're welcome to visit the office anytime (use Hot Desk system), but you're not required to.

---

### WFA Questions

**Q: Can I use WFA time in 1-day increments?**
A: Yes. You can use WFA for as little as 1 day. Your balance is tracked in days (5 days = 1 week).

**Q: What if my manager denies all my WFA requests?**
A: WFA should generally be approved unless there's a legitimate business need. If you feel your manager is unreasonably denying requests, escalate to HR.

**Q: Can I WFA while on PTO?**
A: This doesn't make sense. If you're on PTO, you're not working, so there's no need to use WFA. If you want to work while traveling, use WFA (not PTO).

---

### Security Questions

**Q: Do I really need to use VPN at home?**
A: Yes, when accessing internal systems or sensitive data. Home networks are more secure than public Wi-Fi, but VPN adds an essential layer of protection.

**Q: Can IT see what I'm doing on my laptop?**
A: IT has the ability to monitor company devices for security purposes, but we do not engage in surveillance. Monitoring is limited to security threats and policy violations.

**Q: What if I lose my laptop while traveling?**
A: Report to IT and Security immediately. IT will remotely wipe the device to protect company data. File police report if stolen. Replacement laptop shipped overnight.
