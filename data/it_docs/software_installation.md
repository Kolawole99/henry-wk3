# Software Installation Guide

**Last Updated:** September 15, 2023
**Philosophy:** We operate a "Self-Service" model. You do not need Admin rights to install approved software.

## Approved Software List (Partial)
* **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge
* **Communication:** Slack, Zoom, Teams
* **Productivity:** Microsoft Office 365, Adobe Acrobat Reader
* **Developer:** VS Code, Docker Desktop, Postman (Engineering only)

## How to Install Software

### macOS (Jamf Self Service)
1.  Open the **Applications** folder or press `Cmd+Space`.
2.  Type **"Self Service"** and launch the app (Icon: Company Logo).
3.  Log in with your network credentials if prompted.
4.  Browse categories on the left or search for the app.
5.  Click the **Install** button.
    * *Note: If the button says "Reinstall," the app is already on your machine.*



### Windows (Company Portal)
1.  Press the Windows Key and type **"Company Portal"**.
2.  Launch the app (Blue icon).
3.  Go to the **Apps** tab.
4.  Click the application you need.
5.  Click **Install**. You will see a notification when installation completes.

## Requesting Non-Standard Software
If you need software not listed in the portal (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud, specialized engineering tools):

1.  Go to the **IT Service Portal** (`helpdesk.company.com`).
2.  Select **Service Catalog** -> **Software Request**.
3.  Fill out the form:
    * **Software Name:**
    * **Business Justification:** (Required for license purchase).
    * **Cost Center:** (Ask your manager).
4.  **Approval:** Your manager will receive an email approval request. Once approved, IT Procurement will purchase the license and assign it to your Self Service portal.

## Admin Rights Policy
**Standard Users do not have Local Admin rights.** This prevents malware and accidental system configurations.
* **Temporary Admin:** If you need to install drivers for a home printer, request "Temporary Admin Access" in the Self Service portal. This grants admin rights for **30 minutes**.
