## 6. Equipment Lifecycle Management

### 6.1 Refresh Cycle
Standard refresh policy based on device age and performance:

| Device Type | Refresh Cycle | Early Refresh Criteria |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Laptops (Business) | 3 years | Performance issues confirmed by IT |
| Laptops (Engineering) | 3 years | RAM/CPU no longer supports required tools |
| Desktops | 4 years | N/A (laptops preferred) |
| Monitors | 5 years | Dead pixels, burn-in, hardware failure |
| Mobile Phones | 3 years | Battery health <80%, security updates ended |
| Docking Stations | 5 years | Ports damaged, incompatible with new laptops |

**Eligibility Notification:** IT sends email 60 days before your refresh eligibility date with upgrade options.

### 6.2 Early Refresh Requests
If your equipment is not performing adequately before the refresh date:
1. Submit ticket: "Hardware Performance Issue"
2. IT will run diagnostics remotely
3. If hardware failure confirmed, immediate replacement approved
4. If performance issue is software-related, IT will optimize current device

**Common Scenarios:**
* Battery not holding charge (replaced under warranty if <2 years old)
* Frequent crashes or blue screens (diagnostics required)
* Physical damage (see Accidental Damage section)

### 6.3 Role Change Upgrades
If your role changes to one requiring higher-spec equipment:
* **Example:** Business Analyst promoted to Data Engineer (needs more RAM/CPU)
* **Process:** Manager submits role change notification to HR, which triggers IT equipment review
* **Timeline:** New equipment provisioned within 10 business days of effective date

## 7. Security and Compliance

### 7.1 Device Encryption
**Requirement:** All company laptops must have full-disk encryption enabled
* macOS: FileVault (enabled by default on company devices)
* Windows: BitLocker (enabled by default on company devices)

**Do Not:** Disable encryption. This is a security policy violation and will trigger alert to IT Security.

**Recovery Keys:** IT maintains escrow copies of encryption recovery keys for emergency access.

### 7.2 Asset Tagging
All company equipment valued >$500 is asset-tagged:
* Physical tag affixed to device (barcode + serial number)
* Tracked in IT asset management database
* Annual physical inventory (you'll be asked to confirm possession)

**Do Not:** Remove asset tags. This complicates returns and inventory processes.

### 7.3 Lost or Stolen Equipment
**Immediate Steps:**
1. Report to IT within 1 hour: helpdesk@company.com or call x5500
2. Report to local police and obtain report number
3. Report to your manager and HR

* File police report within 24 hours
* Complete insurance claim form if required

**Negligence Policy:**
* First incident: No penalty (accidental loss covered by company insurance)

### 7.4 Personal Use of Company Equipment

* Storing personal files in separate folder (not mixed with company data)

**Prohibited:**

### 8.2 Slow Performance
Before requesting replacement:

## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Can I choose a Windows laptop if I prefer it over Mac?**
A: Yes, if your role supports it. Engineering roles have standardized on Mac for development tooling consistency, but Business roles can choose either.

**Q2: My laptop screen is cracked. Is that covered?**
A: If it's the first incident and no signs of negligence, yes. IT will determine if repair or replacement is more cost-effective. If pattern of damage, $250 deductible may apply.

**Q3: Can I get a second laptop for travel so I don't have to carry my main one?**
A: No. Company issues one laptop per employee. Consider a lightweight model (MacBook Air 13") if portability is priority.

**Q4: I'm working from a client site for 6 months. Can I get an additional monitor to keep there?**
A: Yes, for extended assignments (>3 months). Submit request with manager approval and client site address.

**Q5: Can I upgrade the RAM or SSD in my laptop myself?**
A: No. This voids warranty and creates asset tracking issues. Submit request to IT; we'll evaluate if upgrade is possible and cost-effective.

**Q6: My phone screen protector is cracked. Will IT replace it?**
A: Screen protectors and cases are not IT-managed. These are personal accessories. However, if the phone screen itself is cracked, report for repair.

**Q7: Can I install Windows on my Mac via Boot Camp or use Parallels?**
A: Engineering and Creative roles: Yes, if job-required (submit justification). Parallels licenses available via Self Service. Business roles: Typically not approved; use Windows laptop instead.

**Q8: I spilled water on my laptop. What should I do?**
A: Immediately power off, unplug, and flip upside-down. Do not attempt to power on. Contact IT emergency line immediately. We'll send recovery kit and replacement.

**Q9: Can family members use my company laptop?**
A: No. Company devices are for authorized employee use only. Family use violates security policy and may expose company data.

**Q10: My equipment refresh is in 6 months, but the new MacBook Pro just came out. Can I wait for that?**
A: Potentially. Submit request to delay refresh by up to 3 months if new model release is imminent. Beyond 3 months, you'll receive current model now and next upgrade will be delayed accordingly.

## 11. Equipment Care and Maintenance

### Best Practices
**Daily:**
* Shutdown or sleep laptop when not in use (don't leave running 24/7)
* Keep food and drinks away from equipment
* Use laptop on hard, flat surface (not bed/couch - blocks ventilation)

**Weekly:**
* Clean keyboard and screen with microfiber cloth (no harsh chemicals)
* Check for software updates (IT pushes these automatically but user confirmation needed)
* Organize cables to prevent tripping hazards

**Monthly:**
* Back up critical files to OneDrive/Google Drive (IT backups recover from disasters, not user error)
* Review installed apps and remove unused ones
* Dust air vents on laptop sides

**Travel:**
* Use laptop sleeve or padded bag (company-provided)
* Never check laptop in airline luggage (carry-on only)
* Keep devices with you (don't leave in hotel room safe or car)

### Environmental Considerations
**Temperature:**
* Operating: 50°F to 95°F (10°C to 35°C)
* Storage: -13°F to 113°F (-25°C to 45°C)
* Don't leave devices in hot cars or extreme cold

**Moisture:**
* Keep away from rain, humidity >90%
* If device gets wet, power off immediately and contact IT

## 12. Sustainability and Recycling

### 12.1 E-Waste Program
When equipment is retired:
* IT wipes all data using DOD 5220.22-M standard (7-pass overwrite)
* Devices <3 years old: Refurbished and donated to local schools/nonprofits
* Devices >3 years old: Sent to certified e-waste recycler (R2 certified)
* Precious metals recovered and recycled

**No devices end up in landfills per company sustainability policy.**

### 12.2 Donation Requests
Employees may not claim retired company equipment for personal use. However, you may request donation to specific 501(c)(3) nonprofit:
1. Submit request with nonprofit details
2. IT confirms device eligibility (functional, >2 years old)
3. IT coordinates direct shipment to nonprofit (not via employee)
