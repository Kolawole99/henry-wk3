## Booking Guidelines
All business travel must be booked through the **Company Travel Portal**. Booking outside the portal (e.g., directly on Expedia or Kayak) is prohibited unless there is a specific technical outage.

### Advance Booking
* **Flights:** Must be booked at least **14 days in advance**.
* **Approvals:** Trips booked less than 7 days in advance require VP-level approval.

## Air Travel
* **Domestic Flights (< 6 hours):** Economy / Main Cabin class.
* **International/Long-Haul (> 6 hours):** Premium Economy is permitted. Business Class requires EVP approval.
* **Airline Selection:** Travelers must select the **Lowest Logical Fare** (flights within a 2-hour window of requested time).
* **Upgrades:** Personal miles may be used to upgrade, but the company will not reimburse the cost of an upgrade.

## Lodging (Hotels)
The company reimburses standard room rates. Suites are not permitted.

### City Tier Limits (Nightly Rate before tax)
* **Tier 1 (NYC, SF, London, Tokyo):** Up to **$350/night**.
* **Tier 2 (Chicago, Austin, Boston, Paris):** Up to **$275/night**.
* **Tier 3 (Standard):** Up to **$200/night**.

If a conference hotel exceeds these rates, book the conference rate and note "Conference Hotel" in the expense description.

## Ground Transportation
* **Rideshare (Uber/Lyft):** Standard or X level only. "Black" or "Lux" cars are not reimbursed unless sharing with 3+ colleagues creates cost parity.
* **Rental Cars:** Permitted for trips involving substantial driving (>50 miles/day).
    * **Class:** Intermediate/Mid-size.
    * **Insurance:** **Decline** the rental agency insurance (CDW/LDW). The company holds a blanket liability policy for business rentals.
* **Personal Car:** Reimbursed at the current IRS mileage rate (currently **67 cents per mile** for 2024). Gas is not reimbursed separately if claiming mileage.

## Bleisure (Business + Leisure)
Employees may extend a business trip for personal vacation ("Bleisure") under these conditions:
1.  **Cost Neutral:** The flight cost must not exceed the cost of the business-only itinerary. If the extension increases the fare, the employee pays the difference.
2.  **Expenses:** All meals, lodging, and transport on personal days are 100% the employee's responsibility.
3.  **PTO:** Vacation days must be logged in the HRIS system.
