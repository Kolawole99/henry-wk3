### Red Flags That Trigger Audit
- Expenses consistently at maximum limits
- Many "lost receipt" affidavits
- Pattern of expenses just under approval thresholds
- Unusual expense patterns compared to peers in same role
- Anonymous tips or manager concerns

## Manager Responsibilities

### Approval Duties
Managers must:
1.  Review expense reports within 48 hours
2.  Verify business purpose is legitimate
3.  Confirm employee was actually traveling on dates claimed
4.  Check that amounts are reasonable for location/circumstance
5.  Reject any questionable expenses (don't approve "to be nice")

### Red Flags for Managers
Watch for:
- Employee submitting spouse's expenses
- Luxury upgrades (first class, suites, expensive restaurants)
- Weekend charges on business trips (are those personal days?)
- Same restaurant multiple times per week (is this actually client meals?)
- Office supplies that seem personal (expensive coffee, snacks)

### Manager Best Practices
1.  Set expectations with team on expense policy
2.  Review team's expenses monthly for patterns
3.  Don't approve your own expenses (have skip-level manager approve)
4.  Ask questions before approving questionable items
5.  Provide feedback if employee consistently approaches limits

## International Expense Considerations

### Currency Conversion
- Use credit card statement conversion rate (most accurate)
- Or use XE.com rate for date of purchase
- Always note original currency and amount in expense description
- Example: "Client dinner in London - £85 (converted at 1.27 = $108)"

### VAT and Sales Tax
- International receipts often include VAT (Value Added Tax)
- Submit full amount including VAT (company may be able to reclaim)
- Don't try to calculate VAT yourself
- Finance team handles VAT reclaim process

### Tipping Customs
Different countries have different norms:
- **US:** 15-20% standard
- **UK/Europe:** 10% or none (service charge often included)
- **Japan:** No tipping (can be offensive)
- **Middle East:** 10-15% in tourist areas

Research local customs before travel.

### Country-Specific Policies
Some countries have special considerations:
- **China:** Many restaurants cash-only, get official "fapiao" receipt for reimbursement
- **Germany:** Keep receipts (Quittung) for everything, very strict documentation
- **Brazil:** High meal costs in major cities, elevated per diem allowed
- **India:** Required to collect GST receipts showing company name

## Expense Policy Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Can I use my corporate card for personal expenses in an emergency?**
A: Only in true emergency (wallet stolen, card declined). Notify Finance immediately and reimburse company within 5 days.

**Q2: What if I accidentally mixed personal and business expenses on one receipt?**
A: Submit only the business portion. In notes, explain: "Total receipt $200, claiming $150 business portion. $50 personal excluded."

**Q3: Can I expense meals when working late at the office?**
A: No, unless manager pre-approves working meal for specific project deadline or client deliverable.

**Q4: What if the client insists on going to an expensive restaurant over our limit?**
A: Client relationship takes priority. Go to the restaurant. Submit expense with note: "Client's choice, exceeded policy limit." Manager can approve overage.

**Q5: Can I keep frequent flyer miles and hotel points from business travel?**
A: Yes! Those are yours to keep and use however you want.

**Q6: What if I book travel but then the trip gets cancelled?**
A: Cancel everything immediately. Most hotels/cars are free cancellation. Airlines usually give credit. If stuck with non-refundable charges, submit explanation with expense report.

**Q7: Can I extend a business trip for vacation?**
A: Yes (called "bleisure"). Flight cost must be ≤ business-only flight. Your vacation expenses (extra hotel, meals) are personal. Log PTO for vacation days.

**Q8: What if my manager is pressuring me to submit false expenses?**
A: This is a serious ethics violation. Contact HR or Ethics Hotline immediately: 1-800-555-ETHIC. Anonymous reporting available.

**Q9: How do I expense something that doesn't fit a standard category?**
A: Use "Other" category and provide detailed description. If >$100, email finance-help@company.com first to confirm it's reimbursable.

**Q10: Can I submit expenses from before my hire date?**
A: No. Only expenses incurred while employed are reimbursable. Candidates/interviewees have separate process.

**Q11: What if I disagree with an expense rejection?**
A: Contact your manager first. If still unresolved, escalate to Finance for policy interpretation. VP of Finance makes final call.

**Q12: Are there exceptions for executives or senior leaders?**
A: Policy applies to everyone. Some roles may have higher travel frequency but same per-expense limits apply.

**Q13: What happens to unused annual allowances (home office, etc.)?**
A: They don't roll over. Use-it-or-lose-it by December 31 each year.

**Q14: Can I get an advance for large travel expenses?**
A: Generally no. Use corporate card if available. If not and cost is >$2,000, contact Finance to discuss options.

A: This IS the full policy. Also available at finance.company.com/expense-policy
