# Budget Request & Approval Process

**Department:** FP&A
**Contact:** budget-team@company.com

## Spend Authority Matrix
This matrix defines who must approve a purchase request based on the **Total Contract Value (TCV)**.

| Spend Amount (USD) | Required Approvals |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$0 - $2,500** | Direct Manager |
| **$2,501 - $10,000** | Department Director |
| **$10,001 - $50,000** | VP of Department + FP&A |
| **$50,001+** | CFO + CEO |

## Purchase Orders (PO)
A Purchase Order is required for all external vendor spend exceeding **$5,000**.
* **Process:** Submit a Requisition in the procurement system *before* the work begins.
* **Invoices without POs:** Invoices over $5k received without a corresponding PO will be flagged and payment delayed.

## Operating vs. Capital Expenses
* **OpEx (Operating Expenses):** Routine costs (subscriptions, office supplies, marketing ads). Approved via the standard matrix above.
* **CapEx (Capital Expenses):** Tangible assets with a useful life >1 year and cost >$2,500 (e.g., laptops, servers, furniture).
    * *Requirement:* All CapEx requests must be routed to the IT or Facilities Director for asset tagging before purchase.

## Out-of-Budget Requests
If a critical need arises that was not included in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP):
1.  Complete the **Budget Variance Request Form**.
2.  **"Give-to-Get" Rule:** You must identify an offset (a planned expense you will cancel to fund the new request).
3.  If no offset is available, the request requires CFO approval regardless of the amount.

## Software & Subscriptions
To prevent "Shadow IT," **all software purchases** (regardless of price) must be reviewed by IT Security.
* **Step 1:** Submit IT Security Review Ticket.
* **Step 2:** Attach approved security ticket to your budget request.
* **Step 3:** Finance approves the spend.

## Detailed Budget Request Process

### Step 1: Determine Authorization Level
Before submitting a request, identify who needs to approve based on the spend matrix:
1.  Calculate **Total Contract Value (TCV)**: Include all costs over the contract life.
    - Example: $500/month for 24 months = $12,000 TCV (requires VP + FP&A approval)
2.  Add implementation fees, training costs, and any one-time charges to TCV.
3.  For multi-year agreements, use the full contract value, not annual amounts.

### Step 2: Complete Budget Request Form
Access the form at: **finance.company.com/budget-request**

**Required Fields:**
- **Requestor Name & Department:** Your full name and cost center code
- **Vendor Name:** Legal entity name (must match W-9)
- **Description:** Clear business justification (2-3 sentences minimum)
- **Amount:** Total contract value in USD
- **Expense Category:** Select from dropdown (Marketing, IT, Professional Services, etc.)
- **Start Date:** When spending begins
- **End Date:** For subscriptions/contracts only
- **Business Case:** Explain expected ROI or business impact
- **Budget Line:** Which approved budget line this draws from

**Optional But Recommended:**
- **Alternatives Considered:** Other vendors evaluated
- **Competitive Quotes:** Attach 2-3 quotes if available
- **Contract Terms:** Payment schedule, renewal terms, cancellation policy

### Step 3: Attach Supporting Documentation
Upload these documents to your request:
1.  **Vendor Quote or Proposal:** Official pricing from vendor
2.  **Statement of Work (SOW):** For professional services
3.  **IT Security Approval:** For all software/SaaS (from Step 1)
4.  **Contract/MSA:** If already negotiated by Legal
5.  **Budget Variance Form:** If requesting out-of-budget spend

### Step 4: Submit for Approval
1.  Click **Submit** button in the budget request system.
2.  System automatically routes to appropriate approvers based on amount.
3.  You'll receive email confirmation with request ID (e.g., BR-2024-00123).
4.  Track status in real-time via the portal dashboard.

### Step 5: Approval Workflow Timeline
**Expected Review Times:**
- **Direct Manager ($0-$2,500):** 1-2 business days
- **Department Director ($2,501-$10,000):** 2-3 business days
- **VP + FP&A ($10,001-$50,000):** 3-5 business days
- **CFO + CEO ($50,001+):** 5-10 business days

**If Rejected:**
- You'll receive email with rejection reason.
- Update the request with additional information and resubmit.
- Schedule a meeting with rejecting approver to discuss concerns.

**If Approved:**
- Procurement team receives automatic notification.
- For purchases >$5K, PO is created within 24 hours.
- You can proceed with vendor engagement once PO number is issued.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Request Stuck in Approval Queue
**Cause:** Approver hasn't reviewed or is out of office.
**Solution:**
1.  Check request status - view who currently has the request.
2.  Send polite reminder email with request ID.
3.  If approver is OOO, check if backup approver is configured.
4.  Contact FP&A team (budget-team@company.com) if stuck >5 business days.

### Issue 2: "Insufficient Budget" Error
**Cause:** Your department has exceeded budget allocation for this category.
**Solution:**
1.  Review current budget utilization: **finance.company.com/budget-dashboard**
2.  Options:
    - Delay purchase to next quarter when budget refreshes
    - Complete Budget Variance Form with offset (give-to-get)
    - Request CFO exception approval with business justification

### Issue 3: Vendor Not in System
**Cause:** New vendor hasn't been set up in procurement system.
**Solution:**
1.  Forward vendor's W-9 and banking information to vendors@company.com.
2.  Wait 48-72 hours for vendor setup.
3.  Submit budget request after vendor ID is created.
4.  Note: Cannot issue PO until vendor is fully onboarded.

### Issue 4: IT Security Rejected Software Request
**Cause:** Software doesn't meet security/compliance requirements.
**Solution:**
1.  Review rejection reason (data security, compliance, functionality overlap).
2.  If functionality overlap: IT may suggest approved alternative.
3.  If security concerns: Work with vendor to complete security questionnaire.
4.  If compliance issue: Engage Legal and Compliance teams.
5.  Resubmit IT security ticket after addressing concerns.

### Issue 5: Multi-Department Purchase Confusion
**Cause:** Cost split between departments, unclear who approves.
**Solution:**
1.  Primary department submits request with full amount.
2.  In notes field, specify cost allocation (e.g., "60% Marketing, 40% Sales").
3.  Both department heads must approve.
4.  Finance team will handle budget split on backend.

### Issue 6: International Vendor Payment Issues
**Cause:** Additional documentation needed for foreign payments.
**Solution:**
1.  Ensure vendor completes W-8BEN form (instead of W-9).
2.  Specify payment method: Wire transfer or PayPal (ACH not available internationally).
3.  Add 3-5 business days for international wire processing.
4.  Budget for wire transfer fees ($25-$50 depending on bank).

### Issue 7: Urgent Request Needs Faster Approval
**Cause:** Business need requires immediate spend approval.
**Solution:**
1.  In request form, check "Urgent" box and explain why.
2.  Email approvers directly with request ID.
3.  If truly critical (service outage, legal deadline), contact CFO office directly.
4.  Note: Frequent urgent requests will be flagged for poor planning.

## Advanced Budget Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Annual Subscription Renewal
**Process:**

5.  If renegotiating: Engage procurement team for pricing discussions.

### Scenario 2: Trial Period Converting to Paid
**Process:**
1.  Many vendors offer 30-day free trials.
2.  Before trial ends, submit budget request for paid subscription.
3.  Include trial period results in business justification.
4.  Allow 5-7 days for approval before trial expires to avoid service interruption.

### Scenario 3: Contractor/Consultant Engagement
**Process:**
1.  For engagements >40 hours or >$5,000, complete SOW (Statement of Work).
2.  SOW must include: deliverables, timeline, payment terms, IP ownership.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Can I proceed with a purchase before approval?**
A: No. You must wait for full approval. Unauthorized purchases may not be reimbursed.

**Q2: What if the vendor requires payment upfront?**
A: Submit budget request as early as possible. For approved requests, Finance can issue payment within 2-3 business days.

**Q3: Do I need approval for expenses under $100?**
A: Depends on category. Office supplies <$100 can be purchased via Amazon Business without pre-approval. Services, subscriptions, and software always require approval regardless of amount.

**Q4: What's the difference between a PO and a budget approval?**
A: Budget approval confirms funds are available and spend is justified. A PO is the legal commitment to the vendor. You need budget approval first, then PO is created for purchases >$5K.

**Q5: Can I split a large purchase into smaller ones to avoid higher approvals?**
A: No. This is "purchase order splitting" and violates policy. Submit as one request with full TCV.

**Q6: How do I check my department's remaining budget?**
A: Log in to **finance.company.com/budget-dashboard**. View by month, quarter, or year. Broken down by expense category.

**Q7: What if my vendor charges in foreign currency?**
A: Submit request in USD equivalent. Use XE.com or similar for conversion. Finance will handle actual foreign exchange at time of payment.

**Q8: Can I request budget for a multi-year contract?**
A: Yes. Specify annual amount and term length. Approval based on total contract value, but budget is drawn annually.

**Q9: What happens if vendor increases price at renewal?**
A: Submit new budget request showing price increase. Include justification (inflation, added features, market rate). FP&A may approve if within budget, or suggest alternatives.

**Q10: Do I need separate approvals for implementation and subscription?**
A: No. Bundle all costs into one request (subscription + implementation + training = total TCV).

**Q11: What if I already started working with a vendor before approval?**
A: Submit request immediately and mark as "Retroactive Approval Requested." Include explanation. These are reviewed more strictly. Repeated violations may result in budget restrictions.

**Q12: Can I transfer budget between categories?**
A: Within your department, yes, with Director approval. Cross-department transfers require VP approval. Use Budget Variance Form.

**Q13: What's considered a "reasonable" expense?**
A: Guideline: Would you spend this amount if it was your own money? Avoid premium/luxury options when standard meets needs.

**Q14: How far in advance should I submit budget requests?**
A: Minimum 2 weeks before needed. For large purchases (>$50K) or board-level approvals, allow 4-6 weeks.

**Q15: What if fiscal year is ending and I have unused budget?**
A: Use-it-or-lose-it policy. Unused budget does not roll over. However, don't spend wastefully just to use budget - this is reviewed and flagged.

## Budget Planning & Management Tips

### Best Practices
1.  **Plan Annually:** Submit annual budget requests in Q4 for following fiscal year.
2.  **Review Monthly:** Check budget dashboard monthly to track spending pace.
3.  **Forecast Quarterly:** Update your quarterly forecast if needs change.
4.  **Bundle Purchases:** Combine related purchases for volume discounts.
5.  **Negotiate Terms:** Multi-year commitments often yield 10-15% discounts.
6.  **Document Decisions:** Keep records of vendor evaluations and approval emails.

### Red Flags to Avoid
1.  **Purchase Order Splitting:** Breaking large purchases into smaller ones.
2.  **Buddy Deals:** Letting other departments use your budget to circumvent their limits.
3.  **Personal Use:** Any company funds for personal benefit.
4.  **Off-System Purchases:** Using personal credit cards without pre-approval and reimbursement plan.
