# Budget Request & Approval Process

**Department:** FP&A
**Contact:** budget-team@company.com

## Spend Authority Matrix
This matrix defines who must approve a purchase request based on the **Total Contract Value (TCV)**.

| Spend Amount (USD) | Required Approvals |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$0 - $2,500** | Direct Manager |
| **$2,501 - $10,000** | Department Director |
| **$10,001 - $50,000** | VP of Department + FP&A |
| **$50,001+** | CFO + CEO |

## Purchase Orders (PO)
A Purchase Order is required for all external vendor spend exceeding **$5,000**.
* **Process:** Submit a Requisition in the procurement system *before* the work begins.
* **Invoices without POs:** Invoices over $5k received without a corresponding PO will be flagged and payment delayed.

## Operating vs. Capital Expenses
* **OpEx (Operating Expenses):** Routine costs (subscriptions, office supplies, marketing ads). Approved via the standard matrix above.
* **CapEx (Capital Expenses):** Tangible assets with a useful life >1 year and cost >$2,500 (e.g., laptops, servers, furniture).
    * *Requirement:* All CapEx requests must be routed to the IT or Facilities Director for asset tagging before purchase.

## Out-of-Budget Requests
If a critical need arises that was not included in the Annual Operating Plan (AOP):
1.  Complete the **Budget Variance Request Form**.
2.  **"Give-to-Get" Rule:** You must identify an offset (a planned expense you will cancel to fund the new request).
3.  If no offset is available, the request requires CFO approval regardless of the amount.

## Software & Subscriptions
To prevent "Shadow IT," **all software purchases** (regardless of price) must be reviewed by IT Security.
* **Step 1:** Submit IT Security Review Ticket.
* **Step 2:** Attach approved security ticket to your budget request.
* **Step 3:** Finance approves the spend.
