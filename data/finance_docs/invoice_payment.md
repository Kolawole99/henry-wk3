Before an invoice can be paid, the vendor must be active in our system.
* **Domestic Vendors:** Must submit a signed **W-9 Form** and Banking Details on company letterhead.
* **International Vendors:** Must submit a **W-8BEN** form.
* **Send to:** vendors@company.com. Setup takes 48-72 hours.

## Invoice Submission Requirements
Vendors should email PDF invoices directly to **invoices@company.com**.

**Mandatory Invoice Fields:**
To avoid rejection, every invoice must include:
1.  **Bill To:** [Full Company Legal Name]
2.  **Purchase Order #:** (If value is >$5,000)
3.  **Invoice Number:** A unique identifier.
4.  **Invoice Date:** Current date.
5.  **Remittance Address:** Or banking details for wire/ACH.

## Payment Cycles

* **Cut-off:** Invoices approved by department heads by Friday at 5 PM will be included in the following Wednesday's run.
* **Check Mailing:** Checks are mailed on Thursdays.
* **ACH/Wire:** Funds typically settle by Friday.

## Invoice Approval Steps
1.  **Receipt:** AP receives the invoice and logs it.
2.  **Routing:** The invoice is digitally routed to the Department Head listed on the PO.
3.  **Review:** The Department Head receives an email notification to "Approve" or "Reject" the goods/services.
    * *If Rejected:* The Department Head must provide a comment (e.g., "Goods damaged" or "Incorrect pricing").
4.  **Payment:** Once approved, the invoice moves to the "Ready for Payment" queue based on Net 30 terms.

## Expedited Payments (Rush Requests)
Rush payments are reserved for business-critical emergencies only.
* **Fee:** A $50 processing fee is charged internally to the requesting department's budget.
* **Authorization:** Requires an email approval from the VP of Finance.

## Detailed Vendor Onboarding Process

### New Domestic Vendor Setup
**Timeline:** 48-72 hours from complete documentation receipt

**Required Documents:**
1.  **W-9 Form:** Download from IRS.gov or company vendor portal
    - Must be signed and dated (electronic signatures accepted)
    - TIN/EIN must match IRS records (system validates)
    - Legal entity name must match exactly
2.  **Banking Information:**
    - Bank name and routing number (9 digits)
    - Account number
    - Account type (checking/savings)
    - Must be on company letterhead OR bank letter
3.  **Certificate of Insurance (if applicable):**
    - Required for: contractors, service providers, facilities vendors
    - Minimum coverage: $1M general liability
    - Company must be listed as "certificate holder"

**Submission:**
- Email all documents to: vendors@company.com
- Subject line: "New Vendor Setup - [Vendor Name]"
- CC the requesting department head

**Verification Process:**
1.  AP team receives documents (Day 0)
2.  Validates TIN/EIN against IRS database (Day 1)
3.  Enters vendor into ERP system (Day 1-2)
4.  Risk/compliance review for vendors >$50K annual spend (Day 2)
5.  Confirmation email sent with Vendor ID (Day 2-3)

### International Vendor Setup
**Timeline:** 5-7 business days (additional documentation required)

**Required Documents:**
1.  **W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E Form:**
    - Certifies foreign status for tax purposes
    - Must be current (expires after 3 years)
    - Country of residence and tax ID required
2.  **Banking Information:**
    - SWIFT code (8 or 11 characters)
    - IBAN (if applicable, primarily Europe)
    - Bank name and address
    - Beneficiary account details
3.  **Company Registration:**
    - Certificate of incorporation or equivalent
    - VAT registration (if in EU/UK)

**Additional Considerations:**
- Wire transfer fees: $25-$50 per payment (vendor or company pays, specify upfront)
- Currency: Specify if paying in USD or local currency
- Tax withholding: Some countries subject to 30% withholding (W-8BEN reduces/eliminates)

### Vendor Information Changes
If existing vendor changes banking details or legal name:
1.  Vendor submits updated W-9 or W-8BEN
2.  Updated banking details on letterhead
3.  Explanation of change (merger, bank change, etc.)
4.  Email to: vendors@company.com with subject "Vendor Update - [Vendor ID]"
5.  Processing time: 24-48 hours
6.  **Security Note:** AP may call vendor at phone number on file to verbally confirm changes (prevents fraud)

## Invoice Submission Best Practices

### For Vendors
**How to Submit:**
- **Preferred:** Email PDF to invoices@company.com
- **Alternative:** Upload to vendor portal (if provided access)
- **Not Accepted:** Fax, paper mail (too slow, high error rate)

**Invoice Format Requirements:**
- **File Type:** PDF only (no Word docs, Excel, images)
- **File Size:** Under 10MB (compress if needed)
- **Naming:** Invoice_[InvoiceNumber]_[VendorName].pdf
- **Email Subject:** Invoice [Invoice#] - [Company Name]

### For Employees/Requestors
If you're the employee who engaged the vendor:
1.  Ensure vendor has submitted invoice to invoices@company.com
2.  Watch for approval request email (typically within 48 hours of invoice receipt)
3.  Review invoice details:
    - Amount matches PO or agreement
    - Services/goods were delivered as expected
    - Quality is acceptable
4.  Approve or reject with comment
5.  If invoice is incorrect, reject and request corrected invoice from vendor

## Payment Cycles & Timing

### Standard Net 30 Payment Terms
- **Day 0:** Invoice received and logged by AP
- **Day 1-2:** Routed to department head for approval
- **Day 3-7:** Approval period (department reviews)
- **Day 8:** Invoice enters "approved" queue
- **Day 30:** Payment date (30 days from invoice date, not receipt date)
- **Day 31-33:** Funds clear vendor's account

**Example:** Invoice dated Nov 1, received Nov 3, approved Nov 5. Payment will be made on Dec 1 (30 days from Nov 1 invoice date).

### Payment Run Schedule
**Weekly Payment Runs:** Every Wednesday

**Deadlines:**
- **Monday 5 PM:** Final day for invoice approval to be included in Wednesday run
- **Wednesday 9 AM:** Payment run executes
- **Wednesday 2 PM:** ACH payments initiated
- **Thursday:** Checks printed and mailed
- **Friday:** ACH funds typically clear vendor accounts

**Holiday Weeks:** If Wednesday is a holiday, payment run moves to Tuesday.

### Early Payment Discounts
Many vendors offer discounts for early payment (e.g., "2/10 Net 30" = 2% discount if paid within 10 days).

**Process:**
1.  AP automatically identifies early payment discount terms
2.  Calculates savings vs. standard payment timing
3.  If discount >1%, AP may pay early automatically
4.  Savings credited to requesting department's budget

**Example:** $10,000 invoice with 2/10 Net 30 terms
- Standard payment (day 30): $10,000
- Early payment (day 10): $9,800
- Savings: $200 (credited to your department)

## Troubleshooting Invoice Issues

### Issue 1: Invoice Rejected - "No PO on File"
**Cause:** Purchase >$5,000 requires PO, but none was created.
**Solution:**
1.  Requestor must create PO retroactively through procurement system
2.  Note reason PO wasn't created upfront (emergency, oversight, etc.)
3.  Manager approval required for retroactive PO
4.  Once PO created, vendor resubmits invoice with PO number
5.  **Prevention:** Always create PO before engaging vendor for purchases >$5K

### Issue 2: Invoice Amount Doesn't Match PO
**Cause:** Vendor invoiced different amount than PO specifies.
**Solution:**
1.  **If invoice is LESS than PO:** Typically auto-approved (partial delivery or discount)
2.  **If invoice is MORE than PO:**
    - Department head investigates (scope change, additional services, error?)
    - If legitimate: Create Change Order in procurement system to increase PO
    - If error: Reject invoice and request corrected version from vendor
3.  Three-way matching: PO + Invoice + Receiving confirmation must align

### Issue 3: Duplicate Invoice Received
**Cause:** Vendor submitted same invoice twice (impatient for payment or error).
**Solution:**
1.  AP system flags duplicates (same invoice number from same vendor)
2.  Automatic rejection with note: "Duplicate - original invoice [#] in process"
3.  Vendor receives email notification
4.  No action needed from requestor

### Issue 4: Invoice for Goods Not Yet Received
**Cause:** Vendor invoiced immediately but shipment delayed.
**Solution:**
1.  Department head should reject invoice with comment: "Goods not yet received"
2.  Invoice goes into "pending" status
3.  Once goods received, requestor logs receipt in system
4.  Invoice automatically re-routes for approval
5.  Payment calculated from goods receipt date, not invoice date

### Issue 5: Vendor Complaining About Late Payment
**Cause:** Payment delayed due to approval bottleneck or invoice errors.
**Solution:**
1.  Vendor contacts invoices@company.com
2.  AP looks up invoice status and identifies bottleneck
3.  If stuck in approval: AP emails department head reminder
4.  If invoice issue: AP communicates to vendor what's needed
5.  Department heads should respond to approval requests within 48 hours

### Issue 6: Invoice Missing Required Information
**Cause:** Invoice lacks vendor address, invoice number, PO number, or payment terms.
**Solution:**
1.  AP rejects invoice automatically with specific deficiency noted
2.  Vendor receives email: "Invoice rejected - missing [specific field]"
3.  Vendor must resubmit corrected invoice
4.  **Prevention:** Educate vendors upfront on invoice requirements

### Issue 7: Wrong Department Charged
**Cause:** Invoice routed to wrong cost center or budget.
**Solution:**
1.  Department head notices invoice isn't their responsibility
2.  Reject with comment: "Please route to [Correct Department]"
3.  AP re-routes to correct department
4.  If cost center split needed (shared expense), note percentage split in approval

## Special Payment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Recurring Monthly Invoices
**Examples:** SaaS subscriptions, maintenance contracts, retainers
**Process:**
1.  First invoice: Full approval process
2.  Mark vendor as "Auto-Approve for Recurring" in system
3.  Subsequent invoices: Auto-approved if amount within 5% of expected
4.  Department head receives FYI email only (not approval request)
5.  Annual review to confirm ongoing need

### Scenario 2: Milestone-Based Payments
**Examples:** Software development, construction, consulting projects
**Process:**
1.  Contract specifies milestones and payment amounts
2.  Vendor invoices upon milestone completion
3.  Department head reviews deliverable against milestone criteria
4.  If met: Approve invoice
5.  If not met: Reject with comment requesting proof of completion
6.  Partial milestone completion: May approve partial payment

### Scenario 3: Reimbursable Expenses (Pass-Through)
**Examples:** Consultant travel, materials purchased on our behalf
**Process:**
1.  Vendor includes reimbursable expenses as separate line items on invoice
2.  Vendor must attach original receipts (not just credit card slip)
3.  Expenses must comply with our company expense policy limits
4.  Common issue: Vendor books first-class flight (our policy is economy)
5.  Department head should reject excessive charges

### Scenario 4: Credit Memo (Vendor Refund)
**Situation:** Vendor owes company money (overcharge, return, discount).
**Process:**
1.  Vendor issues Credit Memo (negative invoice)
2.  Credit memo submitted to invoices@company.com
3.  AP applies credit against next invoice from that vendor
4.  If no upcoming invoices, AP issues refund check/ACH within 30 days
5.  Requestor should verify credit amount is correct

### Scenario 5: Progress Billing (% Complete)
**Examples:** Long-term projects, annual contracts paid monthly
**Process:**
1.  Contract specifies billing schedule (e.g., 12 equal monthly payments)
2.  Vendor invoices according to schedule
3.  First invoice: Full approval
4.  Subsequent invoices: Auto-approved if amount matches schedule
5.  Final invoice: Requestor confirms project completion before approval

### Scenario 6: International Wire Transfer
**Process:**
1.  Invoice approved following normal workflow
2.  AP initiates international wire transfer
3.  **Timing:** Wires sent on Wednesdays (same as domestic)
4.  **Arrival:** Typically 3-5 business days to clear vendor's foreign bank
5.  **Fees:**
    - Our bank charges $25-$50 (company pays)
    - Intermediary banks may deduct $10-$30 (vendor absorbs unless otherwise agreed)
6.  **Confirmation:** Vendor should confirm receipt within 7 days

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Why do you need a W-9 from every vendor?**
A: IRS requires it for tax reporting. We issue 1099s to vendors who receive >$600 annually.

**Q2: Can we pay vendors via PayPal or Venmo?**
A: No. Company policy requires ACH, wire, or check for audit trail and controls.

**Q3: Vendor is demanding immediate payment but invoice just arrived. What do I do?**
A: Explain Net 30 terms. If truly urgent, vendor can request expedited payment through proper channels ($50 fee, VP approval).

**Q4: Can I approve my own invoices if I'm a department head?**
A: Generally yes, but invoices >$10K require skip-level (VP) approval.

**Q5: Vendor sent invoice to me directly instead of invoices@company.com. What do I do?**
A: Forward to invoices@company.com. Do NOT approve via reply to vendor (not in system, no audit trail).

**Q6: How do I check status of a vendor payment?**
A: Department heads can log into AP portal and search by invoice number or vendor name.

**Q7: Vendor says they never received payment. How do I verify?**
A: Contact ap@company.com with invoice number. They can provide:

**Q8: Can we pay vendor in advance (before invoice due date)?**
A: Only if there's an early payment discount >1% or contractually required deposit.

**Q9: What if vendor refuses to accept ACH?**
A: Rare, but we'll issue check. Document reason in vendor file.

**Q10: Invoice has sales tax but our company is tax-exempt. What do I do?**
A: Reject invoice. Provide vendor with our tax exemption certificate. Vendor reissues invoice without tax.

**Q11: Vendor submitted invoice 60 days late. Will we still pay?**
A: Yes, but payment calculated from invoice date, not submission date. May be overdue by time we process.

**Q12: Can I request payment to a different bank account than vendor's standard account?**

## Best Practices for Department Heads

### Approve Promptly
- Target: Approve invoices within 48 hours of receipt
- Late approvals delay vendor payment and strain relationships
- Set up email filters to flag approval requests

### Verify Before Approving
- Confirm goods/services received
- Check amount matches agreement/PO
- Ensure quality is acceptable
- Validate vendor name matches expected provider

### Communicate With Vendors
- Set payment expectations upfront (Net 30)
- Provide PO number at project start
- Notify vendor of any invoice issues directly
- Build good vendor relationships

### Budget Management
- Review invoices against budget monthly
- Flag unexpected or large invoices to Finance
- Ensure proper cost center coding
- Track recurring vs. one-time expenses

## Year-End Processing

### December Deadlines
**Critical Dates:**
- **Dec 20:** Last day to submit invoices for current fiscal year
- **Dec 27:** Last payment run of calendar year
- **Jan 3:** First payment run of new year

**Why Important:**
- Ensures expenses recorded in correct fiscal year
- Affects budget utilization and carryover
- Required for accurate financial statements
- Tax reporting (1099s) cutoff

### Accrual Process
If goods/services received in December but not yet invoiced:
1.  Department head notifies Finance: "Accrual needed"
2.  Provide: Vendor name, estimated amount, what was received
3.  Finance books accrual (expense recorded without invoice)
4.  In January, when invoice arrives, it reverses accrual
5.  Ensures accurate financial reporting
