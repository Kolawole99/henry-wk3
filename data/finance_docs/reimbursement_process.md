**Last Updated:** October 2023
**System:** ExpenseCloud (or Internal ERP)
**Helpdesk:** finance-help@company.com

## Overview
This document details the technical steps for employees to submit expenses for reimbursement. All expenses are processed through the company's designated expense management portal.

## Submission Deadlines
* **Standard Submission:** Expenses must be submitted within **30 days** of the transaction date.
* **Month-End Close:** To be booked in the current month, reports must be submitted by **5:00 PM on the last business day** of the month.
* **Fiscal Year End:** All expenses for the fiscal year must be submitted by **January 10th** of the following year.

## Step-by-Step Submission Guide

### 1. Creating a New Report
1.  Log in to the **Expense Portal**.
2.  Click **"Create New Report"**.
3.  **Report Naming Convention:** Please use the format `YYYY-MM - [Description]` (e.g., *2023-10 - NYC Client Visit*).
4.  **Cost Center:** Verify your default department code is selected. If charging a different department, change the Cost Center dropdown.

### 2. Adding Expenses
* **Credit Card Integration:** If you use a corporate card, transactions will appear in "Available Expenses" within 3 business days. Drag and drop these into your report.
* **Manual Entry:** For out-of-pocket cash expenses, click "Add Expense" -> "Manual Expense." You must enter the Vendor, Date, Amount, and Category exactly as they appear on the receipt.

### 3. Receipt Requirements
* **Expenses under $25:** No receipt required (unless it is for a client meal).
* **Expenses over $25:** A clear digital image of the receipt is **mandatory**.
* **Lodging & Airfare:** Detailed receipts are required regardless of amount.
* **Image Quality:** Photos must clearly show the **Merchant Name**, **Date**, **Line Items**, and **Total Amount**.

### 4. Handling Missing Receipts
If a receipt is lost for an expense over $25:
1.  Contact the vendor for a duplicate.
2.  If unavailable, complete the **Lost Receipt Affidavit** within the expense portal.
3.  *Note: Frequent use of affidavits (more than 3 per year) will trigger a finance audit.*

## Approval Workflow & Timelines
Once you click submit, your report follows this path:

1.  **Manager Approval:** Your direct supervisor reviews the business justification. (Allows 2 business days).
2.  **Finance Audit:** The finance team checks for policy compliance and receipt validity. (Allows 2-3 business days).
3.  **Payment Processing:** Once approved by Finance, payment is issued via Direct Deposit.

**Total Estimated Turnaround:** 5-7 business days from submission to deposit.

## Direct Deposit Setup
Reimbursements are paid to the bank account linked in your payroll profile. To update this, log into the HR Portal, not the Expense Portal.

## Common Error Messages
* **"Duplicate Transaction":** The system detects this receipt was already submitted. Please delete the duplicate line item.
* **"Policy Violation - Cap Exceeded":** You have exceeded the $75 dinner limit. You must write a comment explaining the overage to proceed (e.g., "High cost of living area").
