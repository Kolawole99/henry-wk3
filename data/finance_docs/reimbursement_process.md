# Reimbursement Process Guide

**Last Updated:** October 2023
**System:** ExpenseCloud (or Internal ERP)
**Helpdesk:** finance-help@company.com

## Overview
This document details the technical steps for employees to submit expenses for reimbursement. All expenses are processed through the company's designated expense management portal.

## Submission Deadlines
* **Standard Submission:** Expenses must be submitted within **30 days** of the transaction date.
* **Month-End Close:** To be booked in the current month, reports must be submitted by **5:00 PM on the last business day** of the month.
* **Fiscal Year End:** All expenses for the fiscal year must be submitted by **January 10th** of the following year.

## Step-by-Step Submission Guide

### 1. Creating a New Report
1.  Log in to the **Expense Portal**.
2.  Click **"Create New Report"**.
3.  **Report Naming Convention:** Please use the format `YYYY-MM - [Description]` (e.g., *2023-10 - NYC Client Visit*).
4.  **Cost Center:** Verify your default department code is selected. If charging a different department, change the Cost Center dropdown.

### 2. Adding Expenses
* **Credit Card Integration:** If you use a corporate card, transactions will appear in "Available Expenses" within 3 business days. Drag and drop these into your report.
* **Manual Entry:** For out-of-pocket cash expenses, click "Add Expense" -> "Manual Expense." You must enter the Vendor, Date, Amount, and Category exactly as they appear on the receipt.

### 3. Receipt Requirements
* **Expenses under $25:** No receipt required (unless it is for a client meal).
* **Expenses over $25:** A clear digital image of the receipt is **mandatory**.
* **Lodging & Airfare:** Detailed receipts are required regardless of amount.
* **Image Quality:** Photos must clearly show the **Merchant Name**, **Date**, **Line Items**, and **Total Amount**.

### 4. Handling Missing Receipts
If a receipt is lost for an expense over $25:
1.  Contact the vendor for a duplicate.
2.  If unavailable, complete the **Lost Receipt Affidavit** within the expense portal.
3.  *Note: Frequent use of affidavits (more than 3 per year) will trigger a finance audit.*

## Approval Workflow & Timelines
Once you click submit, your report follows this path:

1.  **Manager Approval:** Your direct supervisor reviews the business justification. (Allows 2 business days).
2.  **Finance Audit:** The finance team checks for policy compliance and receipt validity. (Allows 2-3 business days).
3.  **Payment Processing:** Once approved by Finance, payment is issued via Direct Deposit.

**Total Estimated Turnaround:** 5-7 business days from submission to deposit.

## Direct Deposit Setup
Reimbursements are paid to the bank account linked in your payroll profile. To update this, log into the HR Portal, not the Expense Portal.

## Common Error Messages
* **"Duplicate Transaction":** The system detects this receipt was already submitted. Please delete the duplicate line item.
* **"Policy Violation - Cap Exceeded":** You have exceeded the $75 dinner limit. You must write a comment explaining the overage to proceed (e.g., "High cost of living area").

## Detailed Troubleshooting

### Error: "Receipt Image Unreadable"
**Cause:** Photo is blurry, too dark, or text is cut off.
**Solution:**
1.  Retake photo in good lighting.
2.  Ensure entire receipt is in frame, especially merchant name, date, and total.
3.  Avoid shadows by placing receipt on flat surface.
4.  If original receipt is faded, request duplicate from merchant.
5.  Take photo immediately after purchase (receipts fade over time).

### Error: "Expense Date Too Old"
**Cause:** Expense is more than 30 days old.
**Solution:**
1.  Submit immediately - system allows one-time override with explanation.
2.  In comment field, explain delay (e.g., "Lost receipt, obtained duplicate").
3.  If >90 days old, requires VP approval for exception.
4.  Expenses >1 year old typically cannot be reimbursed (IRS rules).

### Error: "Missing Business Purpose"
**Cause:** Business justification field is empty or too vague.
**Solution:**
1.  Click edit on expense line.
2.  Add specific business purpose:
    - Good: "Dinner with TechCorp client discussing Q4 renewal contract"
    - Bad: "Client dinner"
3.  For team meals, list attendees.
4.  Save and resubmit.

### Error: "Cost Center Invalid"
**Cause:** Your cost center changed (promotion, department transfer, reorganization).
**Solution:**
1.  Contact HR to confirm your current cost center code.
2.  Update in expense system: Profile -> Employment Info -> Cost Center.
3.  If recent transfer, may need Finance team to update backend.
4.  Resubmit report after cost center is corrected.

### Error: "Approver Not Found"
**Cause:** Your manager left company or changed roles.
**Solution:**
1.  HR should have updated your reporting structure.
2.  Check HRIS to confirm current manager.
3.  If HRIS is correct but expense system hasn't synced, contact finance-help@company.com.
4.  They can manually route to correct approver.

### Error: "Foreign Currency Not Supported"
**Cause:** Trying to enter amount in non-USD currency.
**Solution:**
1.  Convert to USD before entering.
2.  Use credit card statement conversion rate (most accurate).
3.  Or use XE.com exchange rate for date of purchase.
4.  Enter USD amount in system.
5.  Attach original foreign receipt showing both currencies.

### Report Stuck "Pending Manager Approval" for >5 Days
**Cause:** Manager hasn't reviewed or is out of office.
**Solution:**
1.  Check if manager is OOO (vacation, leave).
2.  Send polite reminder email with report number.
3.  If manager OOO >1 week, contact Finance to route to backup approver.
4.  For urgent reimbursements, ask Finance to escalate.

### Report Rejected by Finance - "Receipt Not Itemized"
**Cause:** You attached credit card slip instead of itemized receipt.
**Solution:**
1.  Credit card slip only shows total, not what was purchased.
2.  Obtain itemized receipt from merchant.
3.  For meals: Need receipt showing food/drinks ordered.
4.  For hotels: Need folio showing room rate, dates, taxes breakdown.
5.  Replace receipt image and resubmit.

### Multiple Expenses on One Receipt
**Cause:** One receipt contains both reimbursable and non-reimbursable items.
**Solution:**
1.  Create expense for reimbursable amount only.
2.  In notes, explain: "Total receipt $150, claiming $100 business dinner only. $50 personal drinks excluded."
3.  Highlight or annotate receipt image to show breakdown.
4.  Attach annotated version.

## Advanced Reimbursement Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Corporate Card Transaction with Out-of-Pocket Portion
**Situation:** Used corporate card for flight ($600) but paid baggage fee ($35) with personal card.
**Process:**

2.  Create separate manual expense for $35 baggage fee.
3.  Attach baggage receipt.
4.  Note: "Baggage fee for flight [confirmation number]"
5.  Both will be in same report but processed differently:
    - Corporate card expense: Already paid, just needs approval

5.  Finance will validate both expenses match same receipt.

### Scenario 3: Reimbursement for Vendor That Should Have Been Invoiced
**Situation:** Paid vendor $500 out of pocket. Should have been invoiced to company instead.
**Process:**

2.  Contact Accounts Payable: ap@company.com
3.  Request vendor to issue invoice to company.
4.  You get personal refund from vendor or company reimburses you directly.

**Process:**
1.  Create one expense report for entire trip: "Marketing Summit - Chicago - Oct 2024"

    - Flight ($450)
    - Hotel - 3 nights ($900)
    - Meals - itemize each meal within daily limits

## Corporate Credit Card Management

### If You Have a Corporate Card
**Advantages:**
- No out-of-pocket spend for travel/expenses
- Transactions auto-import to expense system
- Statement sent to Finance, not your home
- Builds company credit, not personal credit

**Your Responsibilities:**
1.  Use only for business expenses (personal use is policy violation).
2.  Submit expense report within 30 days of transaction.
3.  Reconcile monthly statement (Finance sends reminder).
4.  Report lost/stolen card immediately: 1-800-555-CARD

### Corporate Card Reconciliation
**Monthly Process:**
1.  Week 1 of each month: Finance sends reconciliation reminder.
2.  Log into expense portal -> "Card Transactions" tab.
3.  Review all charges from previous month.
4.  Drag unreconciled charges into expense reports (or create new reports).
5.  Submit all reports by 5 PM on the 10th of month.
6.  Unreconciled charges >60 days old trigger escalation to your VP.

### Corporate Card Declined
**Cause:** Credit limit reached or unusual activity flagged.
**Solution:**
1.  Check limit in portal (typically $5K-$10K depending on role).
2.  If at limit due to large pending charges, wait for expense approval/payment cycle.
3.  If fraudulent activity suspected, card may be frozen - call card services.
4.  For large purchases (>$5K), notify Finance in advance to raise limit temporarily.

### Personal Card vs. Corporate Card
| Aspect | Corporate Card | Personal Card |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Out-of-pocket cost** | None | Yes, until reimbursed |
| **Reimbursement speed** | N/A (company paid directly) | 5-7 days after approval |
| **Expense entry** | Auto-imports | Manual entry required |
| **Credit score impact** | No impact | Could help score |
| **Rewards/points** | None (company keeps) | You keep |
| **Liability** | Company | You (until reimbursed) |

**Recommendation:** Use corporate card for travel. Personal card okay for small items or if you want to earn points.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Can I submit one expense report for an entire month?**
A: Yes, but separate reports for travel trips make tracking easier. One monthly report for miscellaneous small expenses is fine.

**Q2: What if I made a mistake after submitting?**
A: If not yet approved, you can recall the report, edit, and resubmit. If already approved, contact Finance to reverse and resubmit corrected version.

**Q3: Do I need to submit expenses from corporate card?**
A: YES. Even though company already paid the card, you must submit expense report with receipts for auditing and budget allocation.

**Q4: Can someone else submit an expense report for me?**
A: No. Only the employee who incurred the expense can submit. Administrative assistants cannot submit on behalf of executives.

**Q5: What if my manager is on extended leave?**
A: HR should assign a temporary approver. If not, contact Finance and they'll route to your skip-level manager.

**Q6: Can I submit expenses quarterly instead of monthly?**
A: Policy requires 30-day submission. Quarterly batching is not allowed (causes budget timing issues).

**Q7: Why was my mileage reimbursement calculated differently than I expected?**
A: Verify you're using current IRS rate ($0.67/mile for 2024). System calculates distance using mapping service - if significantly different from your estimate, note actual route taken.

**Q8: Do I need to save receipts after submitting?**
A: Yes, for 7 years per IRS requirements. Keep digital copies or originals. Company may request during audit.

**Q9: Can I submit spouse's travel expenses if they joined my business trip?**
A: No. Only your expenses are reimbursable. Even if sharing a hotel room, only standard room rate is covered, not suite upgrade for two.

**Q10: What if vendor didn't give me a receipt?**
A: Request receipt immediately. If vendor refuses, complete "No Receipt Affidavit" in expense system. Frequent use (>3/year) triggers audit.

**Q11: Can I submit expenses from several months ago?**
A: Expenses 30-90 days old require manager explanation approval. Over 90 days requires VP exception. Over 1 year typically cannot be reimbursed.

**Q12: Why do some expenses need Finance approval and others don't?**
A: Expenses >$500, policy exceptions, and first-time vendors always route to Finance review. Standard smaller expenses may auto-approve after manager approval.

**Q13: What happens if I accidentally submit a personal expense?**
A: Notify Finance immediately via email with report number. They'll remove that line item. Repeatedly submitting personal expenses is a policy violation.

**Q14: Can I get reimbursed in cash instead of direct deposit?**
A: No. All reimbursements are electronic (direct deposit/wire) or check for audit trail and security.

**Q15: Who can I contact if I think my reimbursement was shorted?**
A: Email finance-help@company.com with report number and expected amount. They'll review and correct if error found.

## Best Practices & Tips

### Expense Submission Tips
1.  **Submit weekly:** Don't wait until month-end. Easier to remember details when fresh.
2.  **Photo immediately:** Take receipt photo right after purchase (they fade quickly).
3.  **Use mobile app:** Snap and submit on the go (iOS/Android apps available).
4.  **Detailed descriptions:** Future you (and your manager) will thank you for clear notes.
5.  **Bundle related expenses:** All expenses for one trip in one report.

### Receipt Management
1.  **Digital filing:** Create "Receipts" folder in email/phone for photos.
2.  **Name consistently:** "2024-10-15_ClientDinner_$125.jpg"
3.  **Cloud backup:** Store in Dropbox/Google Drive as backup.
4.  **Mark submitted:** Delete or move to "Submitted" folder after entering in system.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1.  **Waiting too long to submit:** Memory fades, receipts lost, exceeds 30-day window.
2.  **Insufficient documentation:** "Dinner" isn't enough. Who was there? What was discussed?
3.  **Wrong expense category:** Miscategorizing messes up budget reporting.
4.  **Personal expenses:** Even accidentally submitting personal items can trigger audit.
5.  **Not reviewing before submit:** Typos in amounts, missing receipts, duplicates.

### Tax Implications
- Employee reimbursements for business expenses are **not taxable income** (IRS accountable plan).
- You should NOT receive 1099 for reimbursements.
- Keep personal records for 7 years in case of personal tax audit.
- Mileage reimbursement at IRS rate is non-taxable.
- Reimbursements above company limits: Excess amount may be taxable income (rare).
